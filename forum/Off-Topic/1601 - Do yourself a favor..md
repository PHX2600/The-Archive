## Do yourself a favor.

Go get your camera, take pictures of everything you have that you consider valuable, and pictures of their serial numbers if applicable. Jewelry, Electronics, Everything. If possible put something in the image to verify your id, a drivers license, or simply yourself. Store these images on your computer and back them up to somewhere off site, or to the "cloud" These images will be of great use to you later should you ever have to get involved with law enforcement or an insurance agency regarding a theft.

*EDIT*

Also something that shows value if possible, E.g. a receipt.

forced rear entry, feels bad man.

Yeah my house got flipped, luckily the insurance company is being pretty cool even though i don't have any documentation.

Also my new security system is bad ass.

*obligatory crass joke*

But seriously, hope everything is okay. Dealing with insurance can be a real pain. Let me know if you need anything, man.
