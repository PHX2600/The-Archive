## Entry-Level Network Security Jobs?
Posted by **dxh** on Fri November 21st, 2008 08:35:48 PM

Hey guys,

A few co-workers has recently been laid off at the place I was laid off from last month.  They have backgrounds in network/Windows administration, and one has an AS in Network Security.  I'm curious to know where would be a good place to apply for them to apply for a network security related position; I'm a developer and don't know much about the network side of things or what sort of personnel structure that entails...

I see a lot of stuff on craigslist dude. If I were them I would start there. Or post an ad on the list for some freelance.
