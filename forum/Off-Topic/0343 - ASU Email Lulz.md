## ASU Email Lulz
Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Wed August 20th, 2008 05:18:27 PM

On the 18th I got this email with an attachment outlining some changes to several asu programs.

[code:3n124bor]Dear Faculty, Staff and Students&#58;

Today, I am announcing a plan to reorganize the administration of academic programs at ASU to respond to a serious budget situation while taking advantage of certain synergies to strengthen our disciplines and enhance pedagogical collaborations&#46;  Changes will not reduce the academic degree programs or the number of faculty&#46;  The details of the plan are contained in the attached document&#46;  Following consultation with the University Senate and the Arizona Board of Regents, we will move to implementation&#46;

Betty Capaldi
Executive Vice President and Provost[/code:3n124bor]

shortly after that email I received this one...
[code:3n124bor]
Dear Faculty, Staff and Students&#58;

In response to my former message, I would like to say that the aforementioned plan is undergoing corrections and is not meant to be taken as a finalized picture&#46; We will be making adjustments as needed in the future&#46;


Betty Capaldi

Executive Vice President and Provost[/code:3n124bor]


And then just today I get this email from the tech officer...

[code:3n124bor]You may have received an email yesterday purporting to be from Provost Capaldi with the subject header Budget Plan Corrected&#46;  This email, supposedly a follow up to Provost Capaldi's email on the budge plan, was falsified&#46;  

Thanks,
A

Adrian Sannier
University Technology Officer
Professor - Computing Studies
Arizona State University

So.... Looks liek SOMEONE has access to at least all @asu.edu domain email addresses and is having some fun, who knows, just thought it was noteworthy enough to post in off topic.

Oh yeah, staying legit, that would be a good idea... I should probably not go back to school  <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: --> I don't learn from those authoritarian types very well <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( -->

Sounds like someone needs to activate HTTPS on their ASU/Gmail account.
