## Burn .avi files to DVD for playback on a DVD player
Posted by **PHLAK** on Sun November 16th, 2008 04:03:42 PM

Does anyone have a tried and true method for burning .avi (usually DivX) files to DVD for playing on your typical DVD player?

Previously I've used Nero to do this, but Nero has since become bloatware and I've removed it from my system.  I'm specifically looking for a free way of doing this, but if you know of any way at all, please let me know.

For just basic data/audio/iso burning, I love CDBurnerXP <<http://cdburnerxp.se/>> and I'm loving it.  But this doesn't have any video support at all.

Edit: I just went to install burn4free but they force you to install a toolbar, I'm sorry but I don't like programs that do that.  Don't think I'll be trying it.

I still have version 5.5.9.14 of Nero.  I never upgrade anything unless absolutely necessary. <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

I was just thinking of doing this earlier.  Do you remember the steps with Nero?   New compilation -> VideoCD?

Too bad I don't still talk to this "super pirate guy", he'd probably know the answer for you.   <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( -->

I was using Nero 6 or 7 to do it.  It had an option that would convert an .avi file into the proper VOB files and burn them to a DVD.  Worked great, took a while though.

I was talking to a friend at work recently, and he said that Vista has a Windows DVD Maker that does a fantastic job at just this, burning .avi's as DVDs and it's simple, too.

Go figure, Microsoft got something right with Vista!

Note: I do not have Vista, nor am I planning on upgrading to it in the foreseeable future, so I'm still looking for a solution.
