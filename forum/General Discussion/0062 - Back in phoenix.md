Key cutting machine dude, welcome back!
You can order bumpkeys online now  <!-- s:shock: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><!-- s:shock: -->

*If* I order some (or someone else hint hint, we could split the cost), and shadow wants to bring the machine again somewhere(time), we can crank out some bumpkeys.

protip #1: Dont buy blanks from home depot or other big retailers, they charge for the blank and cutting even if you just buy the blank, so a 15 cent purchase just became $2.50

#2: Small hardware stores offering key cutting services/locksmith shops are a good place to stock up (and online retailers)

#3: Watch out for people selling bumpkeys on ebay, I've heard of some scams
