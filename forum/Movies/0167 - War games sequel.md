## War games sequel
Posted by **TerrorDrone** on Sat August 2nd, 2008 05:30:55 PM

I noticed yesterday before the meetings that a sequel to wars games was avaible for rent in the red box. SO i cam home and rented it. Suprsingly it was actually pretty good. While not the classic war games which we all probaly love it held its own. Without giving away to much the story follows a young hacker and online gaming kid that ends up playing a game based on terrorist activities against a government computer programmed to find and kill terrorist by game scores. Well this ends up getting him labeled as a domestic terrorist and of course he must use his skills to stay alive. Before watching make sure to see or review the orginal wargames just to have some background as it will make things a little more clear in the sequel.

Just finished watching this movie... it was GOD AWFUL! It made no sense at many points, referenced World of Warcraft and Stargate Worlds (a game not yet out of beta) one too many times, and the &quot;hacking&quot; (asside from the cantenna) in it was laughable at best (seriously, intercepting a cell phone call with a laptop and directional antenna?).  The only good part of this movie was the references back to the original, but in that case, why not watch the original, Mathew Broderik is a far superior actor to all the actors in this movie combined!

i didnt think it was that bad most of the &quot;hacking&quot; done was a bad joke but i liked the way the terrorist ideas were used
