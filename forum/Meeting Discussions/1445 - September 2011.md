I'll probably show up  <!-- s:shock: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><!-- s:shock: --> 
Sept 2nd .. hmm yep, I think I'm free.
I think we should plan a little somethin'-somethin' in advanced <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> LIKE:

~a presentation!
~a project!
~a discussion! [favorite technical books, favorite tools, what hogwarts house does each computer language fall into (python is slytherin of course), good ol' days, new ideas/exploits/projects]
~see what the new version of the site is looking like, and have some suggestions tossed around, and maybe testing and see what kind of help is offered etc!
~etc!

Cool.

Oooh or a first friday's walk about, I remember doing that once after a 2600 meeting and it was blast.

I'll be there. I don't have a whole lot going on, in terms of things demo-able and/or presentable though.

I Have a Little project I might be able to bring and do a short prez on.

It uses one of those little key-chain cameras that rax showed off a while back.

Plus some additional logic and control added by yours truly.

Yay ^.^
Well, I may still try and find a way to hit up first Friday's (via Light Rail perhaps?) ... but will aim to exist at Lola's for the meeting this time around.
([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX1atmP0Gn0&amp;feature=related](I love that Kink's song))
...I may have some various electronic music circuits that I could talk about, seeing that I am going to be doing a little talk at heatsync laboratory Thursday (if anyone wants to go, there's gonna be people talking about electronic music projects and methods at HSL)
