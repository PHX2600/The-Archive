The sections of the site are:

&quot;Presentations&quot; - my personally recorded presentations
&quot;Hours&quot; - my personally recorded notes of opening/closing hours for the meet-up location
&quot;WiFi&quot; - my personally recorded notes of WiFi hotspot quality at the meet-up location
&quot;Chat&quot; - it also has a java applet that enters both #phx2600 and #az2600 on irc.2600.net

I know a little trick for linking to passworded sites so you don't have to type. I still can't imagine why it has a pass tho.

And to think I nearly decided to trade 500$ in bank twenties tonight for untraceable random change around town so I could run away, take the train to Salem, and then cross the border and die where nobody would find me; and nearly missed this small nook where instead of everyone, except my mom / caseworkers /  a small handful of people, constantly telling me I am stupid people actually find my work worthwhile. :&lt;

Even my two brothers and my dad constantly tell me I am stupid every time I am around them.

I was going to pack my cat in a box and take the train with him to Salem, then cross the border <!-- s:cry: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very Sad" /><!-- s:cry: -->  and make a new life where nobody would find me. :&lt;

I was planning on mailing my cell phone in a 7 day delivery to the white house, that way the gps would be confusing and then disappear completely in the DC area when the bomb squad blows up the box containing my phone due to being suspicious.I was going to head east to Texas to mail it, then take the train the longer inland way around the Rocky Mountains because those are a lot of states I have never been to.

The software for that site of mine is a mock-up software I wrote for the purpose of cloning other people's sites identically in appearance. There is no MySQL or anything involved, just scrapped together mix-and-match rips that are easily hand tweaked, with interactive features emulated. It tends to be ridiculously faster than the actual sites that you can mock-up in it. However, my MediaPlague site got shutdown via crippling my billing payments and blocking my cell from customer support. Apparently the NameSecure hosting company refuses to host web servers with any sort of hacking related content what-so-ever.

I am so lonley and depressed.  <!-- s:? --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><!-- s:? -->

Family can be very supportive or incredibly destructive.
