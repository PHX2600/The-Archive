We used to have an IRC channel, but Jargon was the only person consistently in the channel.  Now-a-days we just message each other with Google Talk and do a group chat if necessary.

r0d3nt pretty much nuked the channel off 2600net, because he's a dick I guess.

-edit-
And yes, jargon was the original registrar of #phx2600 from 6 or 7 or so years ago.

Message me on google talk then! (uberscientist) I need your guys new usernames, I like IM for convo...if you can catch me while I'm online.  I just got pidgin working with it about a few weeks ago.  It's creepy how much we rely on google for our web experience now... it's so centralized (chrome, email, search engine, IM and they're even sending out free hardware?! Genius.) they pretty much know who you are and what you're doing, it's like a corporate CIA <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->  ... at least their motto is &quot;Do no evil&quot; (or something like that right?)
