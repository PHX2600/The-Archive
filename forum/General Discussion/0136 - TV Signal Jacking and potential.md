If someone were to hijack a TV signal today, how much trouble do you think they would get into?

I never heard of that first video, very cool.
Would this be considered cracking/cyber crime? lol.
Anyway, I made a post about [url=http://www.phx2600.org/forum2/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=31:145cgjpd]gnu radio and the USRP>

It would be possible to mess with (hijack) digital TV signals with some know how, probably a lot of reading and programming and reversing the signals coming in.

If only I could get my hands on one of those boxes and a few daughter boards for less than a ton-load of money.  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) --> 

The FCC has some pretty harsh penalties for FM radio pirates ~$10,000 fine (according to yahoo answers...), but usually they issue warnings etc... check out: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.freeradio.org/index.php?pagename=legal.php">http://www.freeradio.org/index.php?pagename=legal.php</a><!-- m --> -- They know what they are talking about.

It would depend on what you wanted to do.
If you just wanted to take over a TV channel to air something else it would be fairly easy but expensive.
I worked with over the air signals for a while and the technology to jam a signal is not that super hard to learn if that what you would like to accomplish.
