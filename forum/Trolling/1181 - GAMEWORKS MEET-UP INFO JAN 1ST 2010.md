I called to verify and confirmed that they **won't be open to the public**
during the specific hours in question.

Gameworks is closing at **8pm** on Dec 31st for a **private** party, but will
reopen to the public Jan 1st 2010 @ 10am.

PHX2600 can't have their NYE party there.

"O-SHIT!" :lol:

EDIT: You can't just call and ask places if they will be open, you have to
inquire as to whether they will actually be open to the **public** during the
**specific hours** in question. :roll:

I will have to call again tomorrow **before 10pm** and inquire as to whether
they will be open to the **public** during their **January 1st 2010 hours of
10am to midnight** in-order to confirm whether we will be able to have our
**normal meet-up** at 6pm at Gameworks @ Arizona Mills Mall.

According to phone call I made 20 minutes ago inquiring as to "**public** open
hours" for "New Years Day" / "January 1st" in 2010.

**Gameworks @ Arizona Mills Mall:

Jan 1st 2010: 11am to 1am next day, "OPEN TO THE PUBLIC"**

We can easily do the meet-up at Gameworks for our First Friday, January 1st 2010
meet-up.

I assume if we have it there, that it will be our usual meet-up time of 6pm?

I expect we will meet at Gameworks for Jan 1st 2010 meet-up at 6pm, then resume
meeting up at Unlimited Coffee starting February 6th.

Most importantly, notice the **dress code** and **after 10pm** rules.

Jargon, that "original" Flobots music video for Handlebars by the film student
is here:

Fun fact: I found out about this song because of this World of Warcraft song
parody:
