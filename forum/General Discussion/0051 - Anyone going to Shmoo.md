Deviant is giving a presentation on the bump key countermeasures:

New Countermeasures to the Bump Key Attack
Deviant Ollam

If you haven’t yet heard of the physical security risk known as "bump keying" there’s a good chance you’ve either been living under a rock or have no duties that involve oversight of facilities or infrastructure. In a short session, Deviant will cover the basics of the bump key threat and describe the techniques that hardware manufacturers and locksmiths are experimenting with to counter it. Some of these developments have real promise, others may just be smoke and mirrors... don’t invest in one of the wrong solutions that are being rolled out in the face of this highly-charged (and often misunderstood) security concern.

It will be interesting to see how things have changed since the 'Medeco meeting' at Defcon last year-

You have to come to my wedding the week before Defcon Nak!  You'll be getting an invitation when they go out.  In fact, everyone should show up, LOL!  That would be great!

In my case, however, I'll probably be working Defcon into the honeymoon (no joke!), will probably be flying into Vegas from Defcon on Thursday.  Sorry I wont be riding up with you guys this year.

Interesting thing, LosT. I looked up "bump keying" found some info on Engadget and found that a Youtube video of a locksmith demonstrating bump keying on Engadget has been removed. Curious.

Bump key attacks are nothing new, nothing secret.

There are, however, some secrets for securing against such attacks, and new attack vectors on specific  lock types (think government facility lock that starts with an "M")-

Shmoo was great as always-  we owned an Animae con that was happening down the road (I managed to get a speaker badge, the equivalent of root in con-space-  and was able to issue 'posse' passes!)
