## Random complaint
Posted by **TerrorDrone** on Tue July 1st, 2008 08:13:55 AM

IS it just me or does anyone else think the most useless job in the world is a weather man.
Do we really need a 15 minute weather forecast in a hour long news show?
Couldn't they just show the 5 day forecast and be over with it?
And how come the weather man can get away with being wrong so often they have like a 50% success rate. If i only did 50% of my job right i would be out on my butt.
Just a random complaint.

The weather man isn't doing 50% of his job, all his job consists of is standing in front of a large green screen, waving his hands, and reading off a 50% accurate report from an expensive computer system with a futuristic name like DOPPLER, NEXRAD, or SKYNET.

The skynet name always cracks me up.
Wasn't that the evil AI computer from terminator?
Guess yo are right about the weather man on tv just ready a teleprompt standing in front of a green screen.
I still feel the time in money it consumes is wasteful.

You could say the same thing about the entire news in general. I think the character in Training Day said it best "The news is 80% bull shit and 20% fact, but I read it becuase this shit entertains me." Zeitgeist

Yes, Skynet is the evil computer program from the Terminator series.
