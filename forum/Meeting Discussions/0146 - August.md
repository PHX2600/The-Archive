I'm assuming there will be one. This year Defcon doesn't fall on the first Friday of the month, so it shouldn't interfere.  However, yours truly will not be attending, for I will be out of town getting married, but I'm sure you'll all get along just fine with out me.

IN the UK if you are at a PUB and hanging with some Birts having a pint they will "say wanna go blow a fag with me and mates"

i understood i was just making a joke about the faggin comment.
I always ask peopele to define things as kind of a private joke.
My wife will refer to something as a "shit ton" and ill always ask her to define shit ton.

I'll be attending, but I warn you that Jargon is taking me. Because we always come together, I try to keep our attendance quarterly. Cheers! retro.
