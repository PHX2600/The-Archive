- The 28 Dollar Tip -
btw, i got a 28 dollar tip at unlimited thursday, and i don't even work there! all i did was help out a lady with her computer for an hour or so while i was at the cafe for 18 hours (the cafe is open from 6am to midnight every day.) she plans to come to the next meeting btw. she basically bought me an 8dollar or so drink and bought me a 20$ giftcard for the cafe. i basically gave her a 1 hour crash course on using the net, even showing her how to verify her access point is even functional despite whether windows is lying or not about a working connection, which was one aspect of the presentation i gave December's phoenix 2600 meet-up, just for her in more detail.

so i basically earned an average of $1.55 per hour during the 18hours i was there due to that. she was really nice to me. :)

- To PHLAK -
Phlak, change my limit from one post per 5(7?) days to one post every 8 hours, and don't count private messages towards the tally for me.

and, sure, clone the meeting history in this board and clone the pics from my site, just be sure to clone the captions for the pics as well, and do not delete the meeting history posts in the troll board. also just take me off troll status and put me as moderator of a meeting history board if you really want to use the meeting history pics and documentation i post.

i actually set this to my firefox homepage and annihilated internet explorer, that way if some tool messes with my computer they take me more seriously when i tell them i work for the department of defense and gain, off-the-books, at minimum 6mil a year in foreign bank account exchange-rate trading.

- 2550 -

2550 will be at Unlimited Coffee at 7th street and Glendale Ave just East of the Whataburger on the South side of the street at 7th Place. Yes, you can purchase food at Whataburger to bring into the cafe. Yes, you can reuse your cup you bought coffee in to get a discount. Yes, you can also be frugal and use the same cup you bought coffee in there for free *soda machine* refills at the cafe for the duration of your visit.

The date for 2550 will be Saturday, December 20th, there will be three 2550 meet up times, 6am, noon, and 6pm. The main meet up time will be noon. so if you come at 6am you can also hang around until after the noon 2550 or if you come at noon you can also hand around for the 6pm 2550. Be sure to call-ahead to ensure the coffee house is even open that day.

2550 is always the third Saturday after First Friday. (2 weeks plus 1 day later)

I will most likely be there from 6pm to midnight, unless i get supoenaed or some crap.

Remember, 2550 is focused on noon, secondly focused on 6pm, and thirdly focused at 6am, in that order.

If anyone wishes to go to 2550 please leave a response here which of the 3 slots you wish to come.

2550 is more of a spontaneous meet-up than a planned one, so if you plan to come to 2550, either bring a friend or don't, and don't assume anyone is actually going to show up; just plan on hanging out to see if anyone else stops by. I highly suggest sitting at or near the street side end of the central table and placing a folded piece of paper or cardboard with '2550' written on it on the table so others may recognize the setting. Remember 2550 isn't an official meet-up, so no seating is actually reserved and other meet-ups may have already been planned ahead of 2550.

&quot;2550&quot; is just a casual meet-up for those that either don't have scheduling to come to 2600 or otherwise just want to meet-up to follow up on the prior 2600 or plan the next one informally. And so as to get together for mid-month plans such as retro projects and outings or for mid-month recruiting to seek additional help for some technology project.

Remember if you need to smoke at Unlimited Coffee, the official smoking patio is on the *West* entrance to the building, and please remember to use the ash-trays that are provided.

- 2600 / 2550 Back-Up Meet-Up Locations -

In the event Unlimited Coffee is closed, check at the Whataburger within walking distance for people first, then head to the Denny's (&quot;Gay Denny's&quot; / &quot;Jenay's&quot;) at 7th Street and Camelback Road on the North-West corner. It is hard *not* to find it, you just go from Unlimited Coffee / Whataburger, *West* less than 500 ft on Glendale Avenue to the crossing of 7th Street and Glendale Avenue, turn Left *South* onto 7th Street and take it roughly 3 or 4 blocks to Camelback Road, then turn right *West* into Denny's. If that Denny's happens to also be closed for some strange reason, then head *East* from that Denny's on Camelback Road to 16th Street and turn right *South* into the parking lot of that *other* Denny's on the South-East corner of 16th Street and Camelback Road.

Both Denny's have free wifi, it is just very limited, I could only get HTTP to work on port 80 from what i have tested, so if you need to use IRC protocol use either CGI-IRC or <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mibbit.com/">http://mibbit.com/</a><!-- m --> . Also neither Denny's has electrical outlets, though the secondary alternative Denny's has a working outlet on the right end of the bar, just don't ask to use it.

Remember, i am virtually always in #phx2600 whenever I *am* using Internet Relay Chat on irc.2600.net djslocker.2600.net collective.2600.net pugwash.2600.net blackbeard.2600.net or madjack.2600.net on port 6667 using IRC protocol.

If you need to use a payphone, the nearest one to Unlimited Coffee is at the Walgreens at the South-West corner of 7th Street and Glendale Road, if I recall correctly.

- Malicious Net Activity -
Please do not perform any malicious network activity at Unlimited Coffee.

Unlimited Coffee has redundant 360 x 180 stereoscopic camera surveillance and a stereoscopic motion sensitive positioning system. Often people such as head officials for such agencies as Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation come to meet at the cafe or just grab a coffee, so please for sanity's sake, do not enact malicious behavior at Unlimited Coffee.

There are monthly scheduled 2550 meetings?  Can some of those be in Tempe instead of P-town?  Methinks a 1am meeting at Xtreme Bean would be HARDCORE while being less hardcore of a drive for me...

&quot;2550&quot; is 15 days after first Friday 3rd Saturday after. People work out when and where to meet-up for &quot;2550&quot;.

Link the Google maps link to &quot;Xtreme Bean&quot;.

Also, 1am the Sunday after or 1am Saturday?

Also, does Xtreme Bean have WiFi and outlets?

There is no rule against multiple &quot;2550&quot; meet-ups since &quot;2550&quot; is a PHX2600 quasi-event not an actual &quot;2600: The Hacker Quarterly Magazine&quot; event.
