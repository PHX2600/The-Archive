## Anti-SPAM Solutions?
Posted by **PHLAK** on Sat December 27th, 2008 03:26:48 PM

What does everyone use to filter SPAM? I'm looking for a good/better solution.  I currently have SpamAssassin on my server and use Thunderbird's default filter.  I'm considering setting up BoxTrapper and seeing how well that works, but I get some emails from places like Newegg and Amazon (news letters/receipts) that I'm afraid will get blocked.  I have 2 Gmail accounts that have maybe let through 3-5 spam messages in the last 3+ years, however I also have a few set up with my websites I want to filter better.

On a side note: What ever happened to Blue Frog?http://tinyurl.com/m5gfk It obviously got to the spammers seeing that they retaliated.
