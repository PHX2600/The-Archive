## PSSH Meetings
Posted by **XlogicX** on Sun February 19th, 2012 09:51:55 AM

There are monthly Phoenix Secret Society Hackers meetings that are run by some of the same guys that organized B-Sides Phoenix. The philosophy is different in some ways in comparison to 2600 meetings. The format is based on AHA meetings (Austin Hackers Association). The format is heavily focused on participation.

Here's Andrew's brief overview of the format:
[quote:2hz0xmzh]
1.) Slide decks are optional-- this is more about showing off things
you are working on.
2.) You don't have to be uberl33t hacker to present, nor does the
topic have to be "technical."  I saw a guy talk on how he negotiated
his way out of a speeding ticket with the laws of physics-- and it was
awesome.
3.) We encourage dialog-- the meeting goes till it goes.  I hope that
means closer to 2 hours of meeting, but that will depend on attendees.
4.) If you have something that will take up >15 minutes to show, you
need to let me know to get on the deck.  Also, if it's your first time
attending you need to let me know.  Otherwise we do firetalks at the
end.
5.) This is supposed to be fun.  Don't worry-- we will all laugh at
you anyways.

Participation is not optional.  Introducing yourself is not optional.
Lurking is disallowed, and a surefire way to get unsubbed from the
group.  The group is setup that people can request access, and can't
read or send things to the group till they are allowed access.  This
is for a few reasons, but mostly because it avoids spam.  If you are a
strong active participant, I have no problem with you mentioning
you've got jobs open.  If you are a recruiter and spam the list-- you
will be unsubscribed.

The google groups link is:
<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://groups.google.com/group/phxSSH?hl=en">https://groups.google.com/group/phxSSH?hl=en</a><!-- m -->
The IRC is on freenode at #pssh

It would be great to have more people. This group is definitely not mutually exclusive from 2600 meetings; they are both different in their own ways and I enjoy both.

Agreed with Logic. I would encourage all 2600'ers to come out. Also, it's the 3rd wednesday of every month so now we have 2x cool hacker meets to attend monthly. My only issue is, I'm trying to bring more presentations/talks/stuff to the monthly 2600's and I don't have enough time/material to do new stuff for 2x meets every month.  <!-- s:? --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><!-- s:? -->

Yeah, screw doing unique stuff for each. I'm going to follow your lead (@Urbal) and just present the same stuff at each. For instance, my presentation for this next 2600 meeting is going to be the same thing that I did at this last PSSH meeting. I'm sure it wont bother too many people, as there were only 4-5 people at the last one that could possibly see it again at the 2600 meeting (and those 4-5 at the PSSH weren't regulars to 2600).

Still, even if we do get a good amount of cross-crowd, it probably wouldn't be that big of a deal. For instance; there was nothing at all negative about seeing 2 takes of a talk on Priming. In fact, PSSH is a reason to motivate people to have presentations, and now since you have a presentation, you can bring it on over to 2600; as the 2600 meetings could always use presentations too. There's always going to be some people that can't make both meetings, so presenting at both covers everyone.

Good way to look at it, and agreed!
