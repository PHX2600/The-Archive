Posted by **AltF4** on Sat February 12th, 2011 11:50:46 AM

Hey everyone! Let's have a Keysigning Party!

I made pretty detailed instructions on the Wiki, here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.phx2600.org/wiki/index.php/KeySigningParty">http://www.phx2600.org/wiki/index.php/KeySigningParty</a><!-- m -->

That should be good enough to prepare, I think. But feel free to update that page with anything you think is relevant. Can't wait to get it started!

Later.
