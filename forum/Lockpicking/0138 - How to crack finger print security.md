This is pretty interesting although this type of technology is obsolete in the
real world and is only hyped up by movies it is still impressive to see how it
can be compromised.

Very cool, I remember being amazed by the news line like ... "Biometric lock
fooled by gummy bear"  of course they melted the gummy bear down, but it sounds
so much more damaging to the technology when its a piece of candy thats fooling
your machine.
