## Cisero’s Ristorante takes on PCI and banks

A restaurant in Park City, Utah, is fighting some of the corrupt policies of banks and PCI. I get the need for something like the standards set by PCI, but their methods are far from transparent. This restaurant had a POS system that had un-encrypted customer data in it, this is understandably a bad thing. The banks fined them for alleged fraud that some criminals used based on this vulnerable POS system. So far, this doesn't sound all to horrible.

The twist is that the banks didn't give any evidence that the fraud (which actually happened) had anything to do with the vulnerable POS system. They extracted about $90k from the restaurant as fines without proof/evidence of the claims. In fact, it doesn't even look like the fraud had anything to do with the POS. Granted, the POS needs to be fixed. However, it does seem like the banks have a little too much executive power.
