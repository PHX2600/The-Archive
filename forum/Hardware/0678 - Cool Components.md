## Cool Components

Ok, in a recent project I used a component I never have before, its called a
power transistor and it amplifies/switches just like a normal transistor but it
can handle up to twenty amps! great for all sorts of things.

What components have you discovered in your hardware journeys that you couldn't
live without now? what components have made your life easier?

Lets have some stories.

here's a vid of that power transistor thing driving a hueg motor for me.

can you use logic level signals to control that power transistor?

Nope, it needs a higher current at the base.

You could do logic levels into a regular transistor like maybe a 2N222 and then
from the emitter of that to the base of a power transistor.

that might work.
