## weird atmospheric conditions affecting 70cm lately?
Posted by **urbex** on Tue July 7th, 2009 01:05:18 AM

I'm in NW glendale (Arrowhead area), and frequently monitor 70cm freqs at night.  Usually my distance limit is the South Mountain repeaters, unable to get the stuff in Mesa (using a 5 watt HT).  But I've noticed the last couple of nights for about a 30 minute window during late night/early morning times being able to key up the Mt. Ord repeater on that same HT, using the factory rubber ducky antenna.  Haven't been able to make any QSOs, but I am able to key the repeater.  

Is there something weird going on atmospherically lately?  Or something else going on that would allow this?  Or is this just one of those freak things that happens occasionally?

My friend nak also has a license and so does penguin, unfortunately nak is in flagstaff right now... maybe penguin could check it out?!

My first thought would be ducting, but I'm not a HAM... yet

sometimes radio waves just do strange things
does it happen around the same time?

Unfortunetly I didn't have the presence of mind to document times (yeah yeah, I know...Hams should always be documenting all this stuff..being that my main radio is an HT, it's usually not very convienent to jot this stuff down), but I'd say it was happening at roughly the same times, maybe an hour or so one way or the other.  

I was thinking ducting myself, but I was checking the maps, and it looked like almost the entire western half of the country was in unstable signal conditions.  Perhaps the unstability (instability?) just so happened to align things just right for those couple nights, as I haven't seen this behavior since.  

Yep, I'm an honest to goodness ham <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->  Got my license back in Feb of this year, after telling myself that I really should go and take the damn already for about the past 15 years, lol.  Since I've been unemployed since last November, I finally got a bug up my ass, checked ARRL's page one night for test locations, found one happening that night and just went and got it done.  Only a tech right now, but it serves my purposes for the time being.  I'll probably eventually upgrade to Extra at some point in the future just for the hell of it.

Ham radio + Chaos theory = infinite regress

That's cool though and a pretty good range for an HT with stock antenna,

I'm in east mesa, near the 60 and power with my radio, so I'm not sure if I could document the same occurrences hes talking about but I could try.

Well were gonna need to build a repeater from scratch and keep it operational to be official.

Also we have to talk on it all the time about our white Christian conservative friends and how the media is crazy these days

brb I think I feel a bowel movement coming!

Well, I'd go over to QRZ and ask for help, but they already think I'm the spawn of Satan, and hate me <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->

That explains it, that's why you have a 'different' personality.
