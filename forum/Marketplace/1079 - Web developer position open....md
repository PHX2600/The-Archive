## Web developer position open...
Posted by **Valveritas** on Sat August 22nd, 2009 09:30:07 PM

I thought I'd check to see if any of you guys would like to redesign my website,
or parts of it.    Someone, like PHLAK, who has PHP experience and examples of
his work online.  I have more money than time right now, so I'm willing to pay a
discounted rate for this kind of service.  I just can't learn what I need to
know in the time I have.   You don't need to do everything at once, nor do you
need to do everything I require.

The site as is:

Here's what I need briefly:

  * A system of leaving comments for each entry and way to leave 'unofficial'
  links - possibly on the uploads.html page.
  * A functional PHP Contact script.
  * Ideally I could also use a front-end to allow me to add entries without
  having to use a clumsy HTML editor from the stone age.  Perhaps this same
  front-end could be used for everyone else as well.

Anyone interested?   I would prefer if you're already an established member of
this community btw.

Don't know how much extra time I'm going to have on my hands here, but for the
sake of knowing and for others benefits as well, I'll ask a few questions?

  1. Would a CMS or blogging package like WordPress (what this site uses)
  suffice for a back end for your site, or are you looking for something custom?
  2. If a CMS or blogging package is sufficient, would you still want a unique
  front-end look or will a pre-designed theme be enough for you?
  3. If a CMS or blogging package is sufficient and you're not looking for a
  unique front-end, are you still looking for someone to set it all up for you?

The answers to these questions will help determine the scope of the project
which may influence myself (or others) to take or not take the job.  Thanks.

Yes.  It may be elementary stuff, but it's not an area I've spent much time
with.  :)

Hope these answers help.

Is this thread still open for PHP developer-hooker soliciation?  Or did you end
up going the CMS route?

Nothing has changed.  I guess the only thing that has really changed is that I
sort of gave up on getting anyone to work on it, and decided I would probably
just have to bite the bullet and do it myself.... starting from scratch,  after
Christmas or something.

But other than that, yeah, it's still open.

Judging by the site functionality, I think Plone has you covered:
<http://plone.org/>

An example of a Plone site: <http://www.delugphx.org>

Thanks.  Looks like that could work and save a lot of time in the process.

I guess.

I also know a web developer that might be interested.  His rates are pretty
reasonable.  PM me and I'll send his e-mail addy.
