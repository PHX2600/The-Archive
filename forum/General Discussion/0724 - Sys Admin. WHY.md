## Sys Admin. WHY?
Posted by ***Hazard** on Wed January 14th, 2009 12:25:39 AM

So. I have recently discovered online that I am insane for wanting to get a sysdamin job. 

YES. I understand I have to be a Masochist. Yes, I understand that I'm dealing with crazy people. Yes, I understand that I am completely screwing myself - what, what - in the butt. But whatever, I like working with computers and one day hope to work in a data center/server farm.

That said, my question to all of you is:

What would be the most expedient route that I can take to becoming a system administrator so that I could then one day become a data center technician/server farmer?

So far my knowledge sysadmin wise has been putting together my own network, learning several distros of Linux and dabbling with BSD, setting up my own hardware router from a spare PC using Linux and IPChains. I also have programming knowledge with skill in C. My deficiencies are that I haven't programmed in C++/java yet, not much experience with scripting, I haven't worked with any MS WINDOWS server products, I have yet to make a generic LAMP stack (I'm thinking of making an online database for my mom to track and catalogue her movies), and I don't know a lot of the products out there that employers want their sysadmins to know.

I'm currently at ASU now for a non IT degree but I'm willing to change my major if the advice is right.

Thanks in advance!  <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

Work for a place that has a server farm, like a web hosting company, data center, or domain registrar.  Get any tech job there, your experience should qualify you for quite a few, actually.  Once you're in, talk to the sysadmins/network admins.  Just talk to them, tell them what you've done, ask them what they do in their job, give them some tips if you have any, and if you have what they're looking for, they'll keep you in mind when the company grows and needs more of them.  I almost went this route working at IPower as mere tech support, and was given ssh access to some of the servers after they figured out I knew how to use it to fix things.  I didn't end up doing that though, as I really wanted to be a developer instead due to creativity+income advantage of it.

Sysadmin'ing is my job/career path that I've chosen...

Learn LAMP.
Learn BASH
Learn PERL
Learn PHP
Learn how the install all the zillions of PHP modules.
Learn how apache modules work.  
Learn how to install from source.
Write your own Apache modules.
Learn Flash Server
Learn WMS
Learn IIS

depending on your niche...there's a ton more things you can look into.  Perhaps we should have a chat at 2600 or 2550 meeting <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

Thanks guys.

Nrezinorn, I'm gonna want to talk to you and 2550 seems to be the way to do it as my schedule doesn't permit me to attend this February's 2600. In fact, if you want to get in contact with me sooner, Nak knows how and I'm on Google Talk mainly. I know I got a lot stuff to catch up on learning.

dxh, you mentioned IPower...I wonder how do I get in contact with them to send them my resumé? I didn't see an employment link on their website. Also, what are some of the other Phoenix area web hosting/data center/domain registrar places? Any recommendations on who to work for?

Thanks again you two.

When I applied they were recruiting at school, although when I interviewed, there were a lot of people there that were found the job via Jobbing.com.  I think since 2004 they got a receptionist and stuff at their PHX HQ on 7th St/Jefferson (I started out when they just shortly after their PHX office opened and was mostly empty rooms).  Last I drove by, they had a sign up saying they were hiring.

GoDaddy is based in Scottsdale, and from what I've seen they pay rather well, however, previous developers and DBAs have told me horror stories of when they or someone they knew worked there.  Basically, they said it was a bit too fast-paced and that people pointed fingers a lot with little real understanding of the problem when something went wrong (someone was once fired for being the last person logged into a database server before customer data was lost/mangled/something like that).  I did once get to meet the company's founder, Bob Parsons, once.  He's a cool guy.

Crystaltech is based somewhere in East Phoenix and from what I hear are a little harder to get hired at.  They require you know Coldfusion, and are mostly a Windows server shop.  Other than that, I don't know much about them.
