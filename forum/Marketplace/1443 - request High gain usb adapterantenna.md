Thanks~

back in the day it was Orinoco or nothing.

I still have my orinoco pcmcia card if that will work for you.

My new lappy doesn't even have a pcmcia slot D:

Just got some DWA-110, RTL73 chipset.  Here's a blog post I wrote about it:
<http://nakedproof.blogspot.com/2011/08/d-link-dwa-110-external-antenna.html>

The range with the internal antenna leaves something to be desired.  I have an
extra one new in box, shrink wrapped $12 if anyone wants it, thats how much I
paid for it on ebay.  It works with aircrack-ng (not sure about packet
injection, but monitor mode works fine without messing with custom drivers or
any of that biz)
