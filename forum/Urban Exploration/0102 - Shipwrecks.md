## Shipwrecks!

This is pretty h0tt -- I'd love to go crawling around in the remains of an empty
ship sometime. Not quite "urban" exploration, but great big empty places
nonetheless:

Anybody have any experiences with sunken or beached ships?

That'd be a crazy experience. And for some reason I'd want Steven Segal to go
with me...
