## Free Energy

I am not sure of the legitimacy of such projects ,but I do find such claims fascinating. Free energy, Zero Point energy, etc..The only personal experience I have ever had with something in this, was many years ago. When we use to repair old CRT monitors. When you discharge the anode, it is then safe to operate on, but when you leave the same CRT monitor over night or in a room over the weekend they build a charge. Personally I disagree they they build a charge from the surrounding electricity such as electrical out lets becuase I have stored these for the city of Tempe in a warehouse and they still hold and will gain a charge. All though this concept was derived years ago. I still think it is an untapped source of free energy. I have no idea of how it works but I will say that CRT monitors can build enough charge to kill a person if not properly discharged before working on. Check this out I strongly feel it works off of a similar concept and idea. Although this is not my field of expertise I do have some background in it.
