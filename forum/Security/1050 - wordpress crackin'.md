Does wordpress use salts in their hashes? if so where is the salt stored?  I came across some hashes about a month ago but have not had time to figure it out. its odd, the salt doesnt seem to be contained in each users row. Maybe its the same salt for each user. If anyone could help shed light on this mystery that would be dandy. <!-- s;-) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;-) -->

yes sir! I just havent had time look through the code (I work all day long doing dev+security, then get home and work second job) I looked at the db structure but not the scripts. Just wondering if anyone knew off hand.
