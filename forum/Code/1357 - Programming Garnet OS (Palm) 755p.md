## Programming Garnet OS (Palm) 755p
Posted by **nak** on Fri December 24th, 2010 03:52:51 AM

Being a fliphone user for years and finally breaking that damn thing a Palm Treo 755p has been thrust into my hands by a friend of mine (his sister's old phone actually, it has a stylus, how &quot;old school&quot;)  either way it has a Intel XScale 312 MHz running in circles just waiting to be tapped (stylus joke... or sex joke... or) by someone who knows how to make it do what it wants to do in the first place... if you know what I mean hehe  <!-- s:twisted: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><!-- s:twisted: --> 

TL;DR
I has new phone, I wanna put C code on it, how do? (for free, from a linux system...)
or does anyone have a 'better' smarty phone (like a droid!!) that would work on the sprint network that they'd like to give me? or trade me? I have stuff... I think <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

Random late night rant:
&quot;We have lost even the vision of paradise, so that our artists and craftsmen can no longer discern its forms. This is the price that must be paid for attempting to control the world from the standpoint of an &quot;I&quot; for whom everything that can be experienced is a foreign object and a nothing-but.&quot; -- A. Watts

as LOVERS of technology we should take that quote very seriously as we move towards human enhancement/singularity and learning to interface with the technology that was thrust upon us at &quot;firstbirth&quot; in novel and paradigm shattering ways, I desperately want to emphasize the importance of holding onto the passion, imperfections and love that make life worth living in the first place.  If there's one thing to take from QPhysiscs is the observer/observed cannot be seperated, let us not become Borg, we could go down that path if my &quot;enemies&quot; win.

Lemme know if you guys have any Exp. with proggin' these treos.  Loves and huggles - NAK

Too late for us. Resistance is frugal.

I think my friend Tuna has programmed ye olde Palm OS apps.  He's @supertunaman on Identi.ca, which is like Twitter for Canadians and people with UNIX beards.  You two should talk.
