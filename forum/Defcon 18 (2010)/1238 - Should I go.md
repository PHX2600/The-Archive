Idk brah,

I probably wont go.

Shit sucked last year. Too many People. Waiting in line for BS. Lets all get together in flag and do our own super hacker meeting or something, we can each give presentations on our recent hackish exploits.

I can talk about sum embedded design stuff and some beginner Android development.

Maybe a circuit bending for newbs talk.

Idk.

I agree with Penguin.  The hassle to fun ratio is growing each year and last year was just to the point of being over-crowded.  Don't think I'm going this year.

That's the same reason I don't wanna go to burning man this year either <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

Maybe there's some desert or something were we can get together in and do fun crazy stuff that's more OUR STYLE <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

The fertile crescent of mind perhaps haaaaa

woah,

If you wanna go burning man style I know the perfect place we can go out in the desert between here and vegas.

all the times i have been out there i have never seen another soul.

there's even a ground water fed waterfall in the middle of fucking nowhere out there.

But we should probably go soon before it gets too fucking hot.

I'll be going this year again for sure. 

Also, who's down for doing the CTF quals game a try? It'd be epic, even if you're not going to Vegas.

What is the &quot;burning man style&quot;? Sounds very Bruce Lee. 

Sounds fantastic, whatever it is. We would love to participate, but we'll need to know when it happens pretty far in advance since we don't live in that area of AZ.

I'd say &quot;let's go to Toorcamp!&quot; but I'm not sure its happening this year or any year anymore (no updates since forever). <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( --> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://toorcamp.org/">http://toorcamp.org/</a><!-- m -->

I'm thinking about checking out H.O.P.E. this year, anyone in?

Isn't HOPE in New York?  One of the major benefits Defcon had over other conferences was that it was in Vegas, so it was easy to drive there and not spend much on a ticket. Unfortunately these other conferences require plane tickets.

Also, HOPE pre-registration is closed.

True, but I've seen Vegas OVER 9000 times and I've never been to New York, which is pretty much a cool city from what the kids tell me.

Indeed, but there's also the option of paying at the door.
