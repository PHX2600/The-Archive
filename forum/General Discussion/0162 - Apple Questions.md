## Apple Questions

Hi! Hi! HI!

I'm not native to command line oriented programs, but they are my favorite way to compute. I suppose it's just batch processing. When I first heard about what apple was going to release after OS 9, I finally became a mac fan. They finally did cool. They came up with a system with BSD heritage, which is not trademarked UNIX or Unix but, c'mon, it's unix (just like GNU/Linux is pretty much unix even though the kernal is different and alot of core utils were just rewritten workalikes...in fact SCO is now arguing that, they couldn't find a copyright violation, no code was ever stolen, but c'mon, SPC-DOS was the same thing as CP/M and Linux is unix, and NT is almost VAX VMS). Where was I going. Oh yeah, OSX is a *nix, tho the gui is not X, which is ok, you can do that, just not many ever did. So that was a plus. Next, they gave you a command line window. Whoo, paradise. Especially when you have it on an mildly affordable risc pc. So you have man pages. And info. You could actually find out about the system rather than just use it. And then it suddenly had  software collection that is giant, you finally can't hear, &quot;us pc users have more stuff&quot;. But then they fuck it up and switch to intel chips, memory, bus. Why? Why? Why? Why don't I just take a PC and install BSD if that's what I wanted? A beige tower is much cheaper to get than something with an apple logo. What's wrong with apple? I want to know, why did they do that? If i'm gonna overpay for shit, how about something modern that run irix? and then, if they are gonna build apple systems, why can't they at least build hot shit systems. they always have mediocre specs.

anyway, i realized, while i can deal with the reality of the gui paradigm, and even browsers...i've come to despise the typical tn3270 interface. i don't want to tab around fields and press pf keys to navigate fields, no matter how slick it is. i'd rather have windows give me a prompt, a blinking cursor and lots and lots of switches. cp/m/dos or linux, i don't mind at all). fine with me.  but it's funny, because i first learned on a system that loaded a funky full screen editor from rom. it was funky because you could double enter data by cursoring up the screen to a line and hitting enter on any party of the line. a little hard to grasp.) you'd think i'd want everything to  be like notepad or something. nah. my new favorite software is phpshell. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> but still, why did apple ditch powerpc?

welcome back!

I grabbed a powerbook G4 for relatively cheap a few years back when they were switching to intel, been thinking of selling my computers and getting a better one, my computer chokes when I try to do audio recording and run reason + ableton live... doesn't make making tracks very easy &gt;.&lt; (pretty much impossible)

From what I understand Apple ditched PowerPC because there Processors couldn't handle some of the new threading in the New Mac OSX as well as Intels Duo's and Quads. But if you can find and old G4 tower,  depending on the model, you can order POWER PC 2 Gig chips to upgrade, and you can upgrade most G4 Power PC's to 1.75 gigs of ram.

They switched because of the power requirements associated with the G5. You'll note they never brought a G5 portable to market. Apple had hoped to get the architecture up to 3GHz but it had to retract that goal. Additionally, IBM couldn't get the power consumption low enough to run it in a laptop.

The Intel Core, love it or hate it, offers remarkably better performance per watt.

I'be been needing a new laptop for sometime now.  It works fine for the basics (web browsing, email, etc...), but I like something newer/more powerful.  I was considering getting a MacBook or MacBook Pro and triple booting it (Win/Linux/OSx), but they're so expensive.

Anyway, I was curious if anyone has attempted this yet, triple booting that is?  If you have, how easy is it?  What problems did you run into (one button mouse?), and any other experiences that may be helpful.  Thanks!

I haven't tried triple booting though I can tell you that there are several less expensive intel laptops that you can load OSX-86 on. You might consider one of those for triple booting. There are a few wiki pages detailing how it works with different machines.

The Core laptop my employer had me using just got retired so I might give it a try myself.
