## Programming for Droid and iPhone?
Posted by **Medicine Storm** on Thu July 8th, 2010 12:26:20 PM

Trying to put some new apps out there, but not very familiar with how to go about it. Does anyone have any experience or suggestions on how to get started with a home-droid-app-studio? iPhone too, but we hear that costs some dollars, so we are waiting on the iPhone end. 

we are using a windows XP box right now. Initial research suggests eclipse is a must, but not familiar with eclipse either. Where do we get? How do we set up for optimal goodness? What other Run-time-packages or generally irritating &quot;just compile the code, check your dependencies, download the prerequisites, recheck your dependencies, switch Linux distributions, and recompile the code! It's JUST that simple!&quot; -type blullplop do we need to know?

We can figure it out eventually (and when we do, we will post the details here) but if anyone already knows some shortcuts, we would appreciate the help.

eclipse will make everything easy and the sdk is super duper easy to install.

As far as mobile development environments are concerned, Android has to be the best.

I second Penguin's suggestion.

I have no experience on Android dev, but for iPhone app development you'll need a Mac with OS X; A cheaper-than-MacPro Mac mini works well though.  You also have to re-learn stone-age pointer programming in Objective C mixed with futuristic haskell-ish functional messaging programming paradigms just to mess with your head.  That's before the torturous wait for App store deployment.  Because Steve Jobs hates you.

Honestly, I would just start out with an HTML5 mobile app (I assume Android's browser has some support for HTML5); If it gets some traction, that might warrant the need for an Android/iOS native app, but otherwise it wouldn't be my first step.
