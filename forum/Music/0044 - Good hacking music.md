## Good hacking music
Posted by **nak** on Sun February 3rd, 2008 12:09:54 AM

Anyone have some music that just gets them in the mood for a good hacking session?

Recently, these have got my attention:
[b:3bjfw7p8]Techno/Electronic/ETC:[/b:3bjfw7p8]
Juno Reactor - Shango (2000) especially Masters of the Universe and Nitrogen
Ferry Corsten - Right of Way has some tight tracks
The Crystal Method - Vegas, etc
[url=http&#58;//razor1911&#46;com/dubmood/:3bjfw7p8]Dubmood- Great chiptunes[/url:3bjfw7p8]

[b:3bjfw7p8]Other:[/b:3bjfw7p8]
Tool - Lateralus and 10k days are my favorites
The Beatles - I mean come together, right now, over me ... for reals <!-- s:oops: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" /><!-- s:oops: --> 
The Doors - Hello, I love you
Jimi Hendrix - FOXXXXXY

yum,

Strangely enough, and yes it is odd and sort of what one would expect, but Wierd Al's &quot;It's all about the Pentiums&quot; Gets me in a 'techie' mood.

I was never really into Weird Al until he did a spoof on ridin' dirty, (white and nerdy), I'll have to check out &quot;It's all about the Pentiums&quot;

It's All About the Pentium's is my favorite Weird Al song ever!  White and Nerdy is good too.

Weird Al's Virus Alert makes me laugh, and I had White and Nerdy was on my Myspace page. I like to goto <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://somafm.com/">http://somafm.com/</a><!-- m --> and choose the Illinois Street Lounge channel. Its a little jazzy, but I like that kind of influence in my music. If I really need to get into the mood, some NWA or some old school metal like Iron Maiden gets my mind going.

In the early 90's some hacker-esque people  I knew listened to Information Society.  Although there's a lot of imagery involving &quot;hacking&quot; like [url=http&#58;//www&#46;youtube&#46;com/watch?v=frQWuMVyZY8:3nu8t183]in this video[/url:3nu8t183] and on their albums, the lyrics didn't really have a lot  to do with the topic.  Nevertheless, the music reminds me of that era, and I think their kind of sound is heavily imitated now.  You might dig some of it.

Haha, nice video.  I like the scrolling text at the bottom, reminds me of demos (demoscene demos), the last part when he said he could make us all go away anytime he wants, I liked that too  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) --> 

Thanks for the mp3 phlak!

Maybe it's just the dork in me, but I like older Weird Al like One More Minute, and You Don't Love Me Anymore.
Hilarious.

Speaking of InSoc, I believe a Phoenix show is in the works.

Nak, you might want to check out KMFDM.  I've been listening to them exclusively while writing version 1.1 of Time Streamer.  In fact, I haven't been listening to anything else for about a month except some 80's thrash metal.

Getting Nihil now, any album in particular?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Valveritas** on Fri February 29th, 2008 10:00:40 PM

Symbols is good. Though I tend to have 2-3 favorites on each album and just listen to those songs. <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

As far as music goes some people say I am Emo, but I disagree with that entirely. I usually listen to Vampire Weekend, Blood Arm, and Old Rage like &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;. This gets me in the mood. Again I practice in locksmithing whether it be cutting keys or picking looks, but I literally listen to everything. I suppose living in Europe will make you like that. I must have heard Britney Spears &quot;Toxic&quot; a thousand times while driving to work on the BBC. I also enjoy Franz Ferdinand, The Killers, etc. etc... , but I am not EMO regardless. I listen to what sounds good, and if I like it, I like it, whatever. I am not into trends, I listen to old and new stuff.

To make you feel better, none of the music nor genres of artists you listed would be referred to as &quot;emo&quot;.  I'm sure you were losing sleep over it <!-- s:-) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:-) -->  Emo used to be a legitimate genre (it ended in the late 90's/ early 2000's) although it was never really referred to as &quot;emo&quot;.  Its over, anyone using the term now is just trying to insult someone and all connotations to the music are simply invalid.

The killers are awesome, have you heard their cover of &quot;Shadowplay&quot; (Joy Division) ?

Best streams ever!  The Trance or Vocal Trance streams are my coding/hacking/development music of choice.

I really like cliq hop on Soma fm. Most of the stuff on Soma is good, though. Pandora's pretty cool too.

For offline music, my collection has a lot more upbeat drum n bass kind of stuff, like the Dungeon Master's guide. (+ points for nerdy references right off the bat, too!) But I have more commercial techno too, like Ferry Corsten, Paul Oakenfold, and random stuff like Eiffel 65. 

Definitely no words. Lyrics distract me far too much when trying to code.

EDIT: Oh, nearly forgot the video game music! I mean, MegaMan is solely responsible for getting me hooked on techno in the first place as a child, no shit. So I've gotta have some of that. Super Metroid soundtrack is really good too. Even Halo's fairly nice, but sometimes much more mellow than the previous two.

Oooh, I need the Super Metroid sound track.   <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->
