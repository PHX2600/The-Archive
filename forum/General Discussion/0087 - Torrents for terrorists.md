## Torrents for terrorists

I can't believe it.  "They" are saying that the money made from copying stuff (music, movie, software, etc) is going in to the pockets of "the Terrorists".  Check [http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080328/ap_on_hi_te/mukasey_intellectual_property](this) out.

The sad part is the media will get a hold of this, and parrot it enough times until the public believes it.

It's truly amazing.

I was recently in Iraq.  They have this swap meet thing called a Bizarre.  95% of the stuff sold at the bizarre was illegal copies on DVDrs of movies and software.  (I got hella pictures if anyone wants to see) I got a picture I took of a Mario game for Playstation 2. 

The stuff was clearly illegal copies of everything, but the purchase of this sh** was encouraged to help "build the local economy".  There was a movie theatre next door, and before every movie it would show that "you wouldn't steal a purse" downloading is illegal pre-movie thing.

I am pretty sure you are talking about the "Souqs" which is a bizarre, like a swap meet. Yea they have a ton of bootleg and replica items everything from fake Rolex watches, fake Oakley's, to fake Versace leather goods. It sort of reminds me of Korea with all of the replica items. The weirdest thing I saw game related was a thing called a "Good Boy" which was a rip-off of the Game Boy advance. They have tons of items from the Asian replica market. Anyways back on point the Propaganda Fear machine goes on.

Although it is bizarre too, so really both spellings apply. ^_-.

LOL, bazaar damn the Google spell check, it fails me once again. That is why I will only refer to it as the Souqs. I still stand by my claim that the Anthrax, Polio, and Malaria vaccine, lowered my IQ. Maybe I shouldn't have drank the water over there. I told them, I have drank water from Mexico and Arizona. If that didn't effect me what will <!-- s:? --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><!-- s:? -->
