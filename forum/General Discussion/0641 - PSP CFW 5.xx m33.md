## PSP CFW 5.xx m33
Posted by **HalfSight** on Wed October 22nd, 2008 06:41:17 AM

I just Updated my PSP to the latest custom firmware. I hosed a few things and fixed a few things. Right now I'm trying to re format the stick and resave all my stuff on it. Basically, I can still play my ISOs but I cannot see my Homebrew. My Custom XMB's won't work. However they have taken the courtesy of adding the USB charge plugin. A flash plugin. and the new firmware has the PSP Store on it. But it only let me in once. and then it gave me the error that I need to update my firmware. I was able to get my homebrews working again by moving everything to the Game 5.xx folder.

Where'd you find the 5.xx firmware?  The latest I could find is 4.01 m33 (what I'm currently running).

I just ran the network updater. It did it all automatically. Just make sure you have 70% Battery.

I'm pretty sure the automatic update is for the Official firmware only.  The only way I know of upgrading custom firmware is by downloading the new version from the internet and placing it on your memory stick and running the update from there.

Anyway, aside from that, make sure you have the latest 5.00 M33-3 you can find here: [url:ug1fc7nx]http&#58;//pspslimhacks&#46;com/500-m33-3-released/[/url:ug1fc7nx]

Thanks for the link. I just went to m33_3.

About the network update. You can go major versions. I went from 3.80 m33 to 4.01 m33 with the network update. I used it to go to 5.00 m33 also. But when I got to that point, It would not automatically got to 5.00 m33_3. I had to put the file on the stick.

I just bumped up to 5.xx m33-4 with the network update. I also got my cxmb going again. With some cool CTF themes. My buddy got dosbox working and he is supposed to hit me up with instructions. 

I need to find the screenshots app.

Just hacked one of my co-workers PSP's today, he's in love (with the PHP, not me).

I'm in the process of a network update right now myself.

the dosbox was cool, He got commander keen and doom II on it, though doom ran like crap. He even set up a bat script menu for the games to be launched by the autoexec. Sounds pointless, but anything to reduce typing into the psp dosbox is lovely.
