So I decided to take the light rail the other day. Had a good time the makin it
from downtown mesa to downtown tempe. The transit security was super nice and it
was very easy.

First I came across this.

Then I came across this little pool of serenity. For some reason it mad eme feel
better about life.

Then I came across the creepy abandoned taco bell.

Then I thought it was odd that there was a couple of dead birds just lying
around.
