## Good hacking music
Posted by **nak** on Sun February 3rd, 2008 12:09:54 AM

Anyone have some music that just gets them in the mood for a good hacking
session?

Recently, these have got my attention:

**Techno/Electronic/ETC:**

  * Juno Reactor - Shango (2000) especially Masters of the Universe and Nitrogen
  * Ferry Corsten - Right of Way has some tight tracks
  * The Crystal Method - Vegas, etc
  * [Dubmood- Great chiptunes](http://razor1911.com/dubmood/)

**Other:**

  * Tool - Lateralus and 10k days are my favorites
  * The Beatles - I mean come together, right now, over me ... for reals :oops:
  * The Doors - Hello, I love you
  * Jimi Hendrix - FOXXXXXY

yum,

Strangely enough, and yes it is odd and sort of what one would expect, but Wierd
Al's "It's all about the Pentiums" Gets me in a 'techie' mood.

I was never really into Weird Al until he did a spoof on ridin' dirty, (white
and nerdy), I'll have to check out "It's all about the Pentiums"

It's All About the Pentium's is my favorite Weird Al song ever!  White and Nerdy
is good too.

Weird Al's Virus Alert makes me laugh, and I had White and Nerdy was on my
Myspace page. I like to goto <http://somafm.com/> and choose the Illinois Street
Lounge channel. Its a little jazzy, but I like that kind of influence in my
music. If I really need to get into the mood, some NWA or some old school metal
like Iron Maiden gets my mind going.

In the early 90's some hacker-esque people  I knew listened to Information
Society.  Although there's a lot of imagery involving "hacking" like
[in this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frQWuMVyZY8) and on their albums,
the lyrics didn't really have a lot  to do with the topic.  Nevertheless, the
music reminds me of that era, and I think their kind of sound is heavily
imitated now. You might dig some of it.

Haha, nice video.  I like the scrolling text at the bottom, reminds me of demos
(demoscene demos), the last part when he said he could make us all go away
anytime he wants, I liked that too ;)

Thanks for the mp3 phlak!

Maybe it's just the dork in me, but I like older Weird Al like One More Minute,
and You Don't Love Me Anymore.

Hilarious.

Speaking of InSoc, I believe a Phoenix show is in the works.

a couple of  eifel 65 songs makes me think of this stuff.  i think there was
deep down and playstation. their not really good songs though :) i must say i
was quite shocked when i finally watched one of their music videos they didn't
look like i thought they would. that was another cd i inherited from my older
brother

Nak, you might want to check out KMFDM.  I've been listening to them exclusively
while writing version 1.1 of Time Streamer.  In fact, I haven't been listening
to anything else for about a month except some 80's thrash metal.

Getting Nihil now, any album in particular?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Valveritas** on Fri February 29th, 2008 10:00:40 PM

Symbols is good. Though I tend to have 2-3 favorites on each album and just
listen to those songs. ;)

As far as music goes some people say I am Emo, but I disagree with that
entirely. I usually listen to Vampire Weekend, Blood Arm, and Old Rage like
"Street Fighting Man". This gets me in the mood. Again I practice in
locksmithing whether it be cutting keys or picking looks, but I literally listen
to everything. I suppose living in Europe will make you like that. I must have
heard Britney Spears "Toxic" a thousand times while driving to work on the BBC.
I also enjoy Franz Ferdinand, The Killers, etc. etc... , but I am not EMO
regardless. I listen to what sounds good, and if I like it, I like it, whatever.
I am not into trends, I listen to old and new stuff.

To make you feel better, none of the music nor genres of artists you listed
would be referred to as "emo".  I'm sure you were losing sleep over it :-) Emo
used to be a legitimate genre (it ended in the late 90's/ early 2000's) although
it was never really referred to as "emo".  Its over, anyone using the term now
is just trying to insult someone and all connotations to the music are simply
invalid.

The killers are awesome, have you heard their cover of "Shadowplay" (Joy
Division) ?

Best streams ever!  The Trance or Vocal Trance streams are my
coding/hacking/development music of choice.

I really like cliq hop on Soma fm. Most of the stuff on Soma is good, though.
Pandora's pretty cool too.

For offline music, my collection has a lot more upbeat drum n bass kind of
stuff, like the Dungeon Master's guide. (+ points for nerdy references right off
the bat, too!) But I have more commercial techno too, like Ferry Corsten, Paul
Oakenfold, and random stuff like Eiffel 65.

Definitely no words. Lyrics distract me far too much when trying to code.

EDIT: Oh, nearly forgot the video game music! I mean, MegaMan is solely
responsible for getting me hooked on techno in the first place as a child, no
shit. So I've gotta have some of that. Super Metroid soundtrack is really good
too. Even Halo's fairly nice, but sometimes much more mellow than the previous
two.

Oooh, I need the Super Metroid sound track. :)
