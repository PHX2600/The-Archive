Scanaday.net is a project conceived by samo over on the BinRev forums. It's
literally a scan per day and it's already turned up great numbers, like...

847-931-9951

Participate if you can!  It doesn't take long to scan one hundred numbers and
<http://www.handscan.net/> can help.

The website is

<http://www.scanaday.net/>

and the original forum post is at

Sounds interesting, I'll take a look at it and see about contributing.

Edit: I dialed that 847 number you listed, what is it?  All I hear is pulsing.
Is it some sort of digital transmission?

Guess is a broken reorder. Email scans to handscanaday at gmail dot com.
