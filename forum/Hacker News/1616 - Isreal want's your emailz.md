## Isreal want's your emailz
Posted by **XlogicX** on Fri June 15th, 2012 07:39:10 AM

So Israel wants your email credentials if you're a tourist with an Arab name.

So I'm thinking,

  1. register fake email account
  2. craft malicious emails that pwn the person opening them
  3. give them clever subject lines like: Pjear the awesome powerz of Alah
  4. ?
  5. Profit

Not to grave-dig this thread, but this is a great time to mention the plethora
of free, temporary e-mail addresses out there:

  * <http://www.guerrillamail.com>
  * <http://www.disposableinbox.com>
  * <http://www.10minutemail.com>
  * <http://www.mailinator.com>
