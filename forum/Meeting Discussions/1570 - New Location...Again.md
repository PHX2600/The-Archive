## New Location...Again
Posted by **XlogicX** on Sun March 4th, 2012 07:11:07 AM

We need a location, this thread can serve as the discussion. After all the places we've been, we have a bit of experience of what we like, dislike, and require. Here are some things to consider:

Requirements:
-PUBLIC: the places has to be public. Every time we lose a location, we always have someone recommending to move the meeting to their house. This is never an option (at least, if it is to be an OFFICIAL 2600 meeting). I know there is some debate about what is public and what is private. The spirit of this rule is three-fold. One reason we want to meet in a public-ish place is to give random outsiders the chance to accidentally stumble into our group. Another reason is to lower the intimidation of those that have not gone to a meeting before (someone's house is a barrier to most). Another reason that has often been stated by Emmanuel is regards to the authorities. Meeting in the open shows that we have nothing to hide and makes us a lot less suspicious. I listed this first because it is always a sore debate. If you don't like public-ISH places, there are other groups, or you can start your own...and we will probably show up to that as well, but it wouldn't be 2600.

-Allows presentations: A place that isn't going to get skiddish about a bunch of hackers talking about potentially unpopular topics (from the perception of an outsider)


Guidelines:
-WiFi: not required, but would be really nice

-Enough space: not just enough space, but enough space on a Friday
    -Indoor area; a large enough portion of the space should be in-doors...it's Phoenix, it's hot.

-Central Location: as close to downtown Phoenix as possible. edge-locations attract less people.

-Good hours: It kind of sucks when a place closes around 7 or 8, but we will deal with it if we have to

-Not too loud: We're used to some noise, but we don't want too much noise, consider presentations

-Not a Starbucks: just a personal preference. And trust me, corporate places eventually have issues with our crowd.

-A place that would allow us to consistently meet every 1st Friday: Of course we could reserve a nice area at some places, but doing so on a monthly basis could be a different challenge. 


Types of places to consider:
-Independent coffee shops
-Bookstores
-Bowling Alleys
-Food places (maybe)

Places we don't like:
-Corporate places
-Somebodies house
-Classroom environments (I'm not speaking for everyone on this, but I'm not the only one that gets a bad vibe from these types of locations, such as our experience with UAT)
-Libraries (I guess the neo-nazi's ruined this for us)
-Food Courts in a Mall (Although this is a fairly universal type of location from looking at the back of a 2600 mag, food courts in a mall suck. We've done it with Arizona Mills, security didn't allow us to do our "business")

Did I hear someone recommend bookmans? 

I think that would be an awesome location if they have space.

Here's a map of coffee shops that are proximate to our current location.

I don't think I've ever been to Bookmans, but it sounds like a potentially good location.  Is anyone able to scout the area and/or ask a manager there if it'd be alright to meet there?  Also, does Bookmans have teh WiFi?

I have extended an olive branch to Bookmans...

[quote:264pdxu2]
Hello,

I represent a small group of computer enthusiasts who are looking for a new home for their monthly meetings, We heard that Bookmans may have some kind of available event space which we might be able to use. We would be looking for space to host 20-30 people for approximately 2-4 hours every first Friday of the month. Preferably in the evenings, say 5pm thru 9pm or thereabouts.

Please let me know if this would be a possibility.

Best regards,

The Batman

I gave FOR REALS contact info, didn't actually sign as the batman lol.

I just don't trust all you forum trolls with all the contact info I gave to bookmans.

First off I would like to say I liked Lola's as a location but I didn't like their coffee...at all so I'm excited about new coffee.  

Second, I don't know if this is even possible but I work/live West side so all the locations that I have connection with are over here.  The first one I would suggest is Coffee  &amp;  Tea express.  The main barista, David, is a former network admin and still a geek.  I asked him a while back if I could use his place for a 2600 type meeting and he was fine with it as long as members bought coffee. I think he would not only appreciate the group but actively participate.  Only down side is the size of the shop...we would probably take it over completely.  I can testify to the amazingness of the coffee since I drink it 4 days a week.  I also know they have wifi since I bought a new router for them a couple of weeks ago. They have a wide variety of fare market tea as well as a full kitchen where they prepare light meals, baked goods, etc.

**Coffee  &amp;  Tea Express
5835 W. Palmaire Avenue? Ste E ?
Glendale, AZ 85302**
<http://coffeeandteaexpress.com/>

The second place that could be good is the Gas Light Inn.  Its a coffee shop with a huge amount of space.  They actually have a whole room that could fit our group and it looks like they aren't even using it right now.  I have never been to the Gas Light Inn...I just walk by it everyday as I go to Coffee and Tea express but it just reopened with new owners so they are probably looking for any opportunity to drum up business.  Lots of space, coffee (I'm told the barista used to work with Dave at Coffee  &amp;  Tea), a decent sized menu for appetizers and light meals and confections.

**Gas Light Inn
5747 West Glendale Avenue  
Glendale, AZ 85301**

Last option I have to offer being an alumni of DeVry and a current student at Keller I could look into using the campus at 19th Ave  &amp;  Dunlap (Phoenix Campus) or the campus at Westgate (Glendale Campus).  Westgate has plenty of amenities restaurants, bars, shopping, and lots of sheeple to mess with on a Friday night  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->  Phoenix campus...ummm...not so much.

Those are a bit west, but worth checking out. Thanks ^subV

Posted by **PHLAK** on Wed March 7th, 2012 08:24:25 PM

Thanks ^SubV, those coffee shops look good.  Being a DeVry alumni myself I don't think the Phoenix campus would work very well.  Curious though, how's the parking at either of those coffee shops?

Coffee  &amp;  Tea Express is a shop built into the back side of a brand new parking garage so plenty of parking available.  I actually talked to the head barista Dave today about using his place for our meeting.  He said that they close at 4 PM so they would have to open up for us...which he was more than happy to do but he has to make sure it makes business sense to staff the place...basically if we had 20 people there and only 1 person buys a coffee he can’t justify opening the place up for us.  The capacity for the shop is 32 and Dave and I counted chairs and they have 28 total.  

I also contacted the Gas Light Inn and tried their coffee.  The barista there gave me a business card for the owners and told me to contact them but he thought that we would have to rent the room if we wanted dedicated space.  He said to be sure I should contact the owners...with a group our size they may not make us rent. In case you were wondering the Coffee was just okay...but I probably shouldn't pass judgment without giving it a couple of tries.  Parking at the Gas Light Inn shouldn't be an issue since there is all kinds of parking down town Glendale. There are parking lots across the street a few spots in front of the Gas Light Inn and a parking lot behind.  There is also a public parking structure just down the street from the Gas Light Inn between the Glendale City Court and the main Glendale Police station plus the parking structure that Coffee  &amp;  Tea Express is next too. 

I also talked with a couple of the folks in Glendale IT and found out one of them has actually contributed to 2600 mag on a couple of occasions.  It wouldn't surprise me should we choose one of the Glendale locations if we picked up a few Glendale IT folk as members since we are two minute walk away.  

As a final note...I attend several IT professional groups as well as non professional ( i know I'm a cheater - don't hate the playa hate the game) but I've noticed that all of them are central and east side groups.  If we are looking to grow attendance being the only IT group more west may help dramatically. Just a thought.  

I don't want to seem like I'm pushing for a westward move.  No matter where we end up I'm in...I currently drive 1 hr 15+ min in rush hour traffic on my day off to get to Lola's and drink bad coffee with the gang so not much is going to deter me!

When I get a free moment, I'm going to check out this place:
Fair Trade Cafe?
1020 North 1st Avenue
Phoenix, AZ 85003
(602) 354-8150

I've only checked out google maps so far (they have an inside view for this shop). Hours are good (10pm), size looks decent, and it's as close to downtown as it gets. The only thing I don't know about is presentations, so that's what I'll have to find out. Unless there are other objections to the place. But this is only a suggestion among the others.

I checked it out yesterday.

Pros:
It's a coffee shop, wifi, outdoors area with patio furniture, indoors area with some tables.
Right next to the light rail.

Cons:
Very close to "First Fridays" art walk, as well as live music during the event.
Tables would be difficult to push together like we do at Lola's, and probably not really possible because it seems like a relatively busy joint.

Any decisions made yet on where we will be meeting this Friday???  Found out that Gas Light Inn won't work...they have a live band on 1st Friday of every month.  Coffee  &amp;  Tea Express is still a possibility but it may be too late to set it up for this Friday since this is after hours and they would have to open up special for us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **PHLAK** on Tue April 3rd, 2012 03:38:13 PM

We will be meeting at the regular place (Citizen Espresso Bar, formerly Lola Coffee) this Friday as no other viable locations have been found yet.  Durring this meeting discussing a new location will be a high priority.  Hopefully we can come up with something in time for the May meeting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Urbal** on Tue April 3rd, 2012 04:35:19 PM

I've got a wedding in CA to attend so i'll miss this friday. I was given the # to Tiffany, the new owner of Citizen or whatever LoLa is called now. Anyway, she asked me to contact her. I've called 3x's and left 3 messages with absolutely no contact soooooo fuck 'em. If having a projector up for 1hr a month is worth all the lost business, so be it.

Posted by **XlogicX** on Wed April 4th, 2012 01:03:24 AM

If we still have some good candidates that haven't turned into dead ends, maybe we can have an after meeting field trip. We have done this a few times before:

When we used to meet at the AZ Mills food court, security saw our laptops out and told us that we couldn't "do business" in the food court. We started meeting at Borders in the Biltmore that very same day.

When we started to get a little tired of meeting at Nicks Pizza, some of us scoped out Counter Culture right after the meeting; this is where we met the next month.

I'm just not sure what places we have in mind that we haven't already crossed out. Nak already checked out the place I was going to take a look at, and he made plenty of arguments for why it wouldn't be a suitable place.

I look forward to the meeting regardless

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FYI - Talked to Dave at Coffee  &amp;  Tea Express he says he is still good if we want to meet there next month.  I didn't ask about this Friday but I can if you want.
