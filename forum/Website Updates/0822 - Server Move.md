## Server Move
Posted by **PHLAK** on Wed June 3rd, 2009 11:31:36 PM

**What:** Planned Server Migration
**When:** June 20th, 11:00pm to June 21st 9:00am (Arizona times)

I have recently purchased a new Virtual Private Server and will be moving
PHX2600.org to this server on the night of **June 20th**.  The site/forums will
most likely be down from around 11pm that night until sometime the next morning
(I'm shooting for 8-9am) while DNS propagates.

With this new server should come better performance and faster page loading
times (not that they were slow to begin with) and perhaps one or two new
"features" that I'm not willing to discuss at this time (I don't want to get
your hopes up if things fall through).

XlogicX and (mostly) I will be doing everything we can to make sure this
transition goes smooth and the site is back up in a timely fashion.

As always, please leave any questions or comments here.

Good work man.  But first comes migration, then copulation, and then
propagation!

Move is complete, site and boards are back online.

There are known problems with the Wordpress install I'm working to resolve,
please be patient.

Narrowed the problem down to a plugin.  Investigating now.

Ok, the problem was with the PHPBB latest topics plugin, so I disabled it and
now we're good to go.

**PHX2600.org is now fully up and running on the new server!**
