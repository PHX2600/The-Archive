## Proposed new meeting location: Cartel Coffee (Tempe)
Posted by **PHLAK** on Tue March 19th, 2013 10:50:51 PM

I recently went to Cartel Coffee lab in Tempe and they've expanded... a lot!  Seeing that limited space was our only real beef with Cartel previously I'd like to propose that we reconsider it as an option for future meetings.  We could do a test meeting there.  Maybe not April since that's only a few weeks away, but how about May?  I can also talk to someone there to find out what their policies on large groups are and maybe snap a few pics if I can find the time.

I'd also add checking to see if they mind us doing &quot;presentations&quot; there.

I vote yes as well. FYI, google maps does have an internal 360 view of the place. The place looks great though.

That 360 view is from before any remodling.  They've at LEAST doubled in size since then.
