## UPDATES: Anti-Spam and Defcon
Posted by **PHLAK** on Tue May 12th, 2009 01:37:04 AM

Boards were down for some unscheduled maintanance tonight.  Sorry for any
inconveniences this may have caused.

With this maintenance I accomplished two valuable tasks.  The first, I have
implemented some advanced anti-spam measures (most of which should be invisible
to then end user), and secondly, I have added a Defcon Discussions forum for
Defcon planning, collaboration, etc.  Please keep all Defcon related threads in
their respective forums from now on, and if notify me of any new or old threads
that need to be moved.

Thank you, and as always, if you have any questions or comments, please post
them here.
