Loved it. Loved the music, loved the content, loved the underground feel. Companion site, not so much: I don't want to register, needs front page links to latest show and archives, Dissident Matrix name should be more prominent... Whatever, just give me more shows!

I think Fightgar is a friend of Nak's, maybe he posted for him.
