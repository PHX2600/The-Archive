## Use of the term "hacker"
Posted by **TerrorDrone** on Thu July 24th, 2008 06:15:13 PM

I think the term "hacker might be one of the most over used terms in modern lanauage today. Even Lori drew the chick from the myspace suicide case is been tried as a "hacker" simplely because she lied about who she was on there and just about every skilless script kiddie  out there is being refered to as a "hacker".

This thread is now about gin, I haven't tried it... do you think it would be a good starting point for a mixed drink called the pan galactic gurgle blaster? Or should I distill some pure ethanol and just mix it with some citric acid and lemon oil, THE HARDEST DRINK KNOWN TO MAN.

*edit*
Haha, people have already made some recipes: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending/Cocktails/Pan_Galactic_Gargle_Blaster">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending ... le_Blaster</a><!-- m -->

It is described "Like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick." so keep that in mind if you want to try and make a recipe.

i think vodka would be a good starting point
gin is kinda ruff at times guess all depends on what brand you buy 
the plastic bottles of it at albertsons will hurt and hurt bad 
last night was tangerie and coke for me
wine always makes me feel like my brain has been smashed in the next day

i was about to write a long and rambley reply and explain that i had a shot of vodka but now you are talking about vodka so its ok. and yes it was just one. i havent touched alcohol in more than a year so i kinda feel it more than i should but anyway

im not even a hacker but it annoys me. 

like

you give your password to someone pretending to be an aol systems admin and you yell OMG I GOT HACKED when your account is used for trolling purposes and to post about vegetable oil 

not that ive done that. but i have. i mean the admin part, not the part about giving my password out. 

LOL LORI DREW ok i just read the original post. doesnt anyone think megan meyers mom should be tried for something because she was the one who helped her 13 year old kid sign up for myspace to be more popular and you have to be 14 to use the site. so she broke a law. even tho it is rather lame to pick on a 13 year old while pretending to be a guy.

altho i use the term "hey lets create a josh" to reference creating a fake profile to see someone elses profile. :lurk: i havent done it tho. but if i did it would be called josh

Gin can be quite good or horrendous depending on the label.  I would stay away from anything in a plastic bottle.  Personally, Bombay Sapphire would be my top pick.  Same thing goes for Vodka.  Even when you run cheap vodka through a graphite-based water filter it still doesn't make it taste less like diesel.

Not to totally change topic, but has anyone tried absinthe?

I never tried it my self becuase I know the truth, that only a small handful of countries still sell it to the public. The rest is just a knock off and use of the name to increase sales. It's like the Cuban cigars you can get in Mexico, Cuban my ass. You sort of have to know your stuff when dealing in scarce commodities. I also read in the paper a while back that it was on US shelves again. It was just all media hype BS as usual. Don't be fooled and waste your money unless you know what you are buying. The sad thing is people have been importing this stuff the same as knock off clothes, electronics, etc, etc. It is crap and doesn't make you hallucinate any more than Jägermeister. There is also a way to drink it traditionally.

absinthee is pretty interresting i have had the the pleasure(and i use the term lightly) of that experience while in europe.
You can buy absinthee kits online but dont know if its the same thing. They have this stuff in Korea called soju that is pretty interresting like a moonshine of sorts so you never really know what your getting in it had a buddy over there go blind for three days from it. 
This myspace thing is kinda scary cause the way it reads to me is if you lie about something over the internet or violate a user term agreement in any ways its computer fraud which doesn't seem like a good thing.Stills bothers me to refer to her as a hacker for this.
And i'm not a Hacker i am a "modern technology security, application and experitmentation enthusiast."

The term hacker is too confused, I'm going to avoid the term. Only my dad has ever called me a hacker and that was just because I ported our program, just a quickie that listened and accepted socket connections then did some processing then sent messages back, to linux. It was nothing really, i thought it was a good idea to do because we both hate microsoft corporation and weren't planning on putting just another windows box at the data center. Later we cancelled the project. With that tangent aside, if the hacking community can't agree on what the term hacker means then the media won't ever be set straight. If you're 12 and say your 13 over telecommunication lines, that is fraud. I actually read some stuff at phrack, and I think the "movie hackers", I mean the kind of hackers the media depicts, just call themselves the underground and they're a community and it's dying community. If you're a movie hacker and they don't know you then you aren't one of them, so that's something i never understood before my visit. 

But really I wanted to talk about booze and one time in particular. It' was the strangest thing ever. I drank four or five heinekens (my favorite beer) and unusually couldn't sleep, i was up four a day and a half when beer is supposed to make you pass out. Then, I was staring at my wall and damned if I didn't have a true to life, balls to bone, authentic halllucenation. It was wierd. I saw Frederick Douglas on my bedroom wall. It looked as if my wall was a web browser set to view a jpeg of Frederick Douglas. The wierdest thing. I've taken college psychology and while i can't explain why i couldn't sleep, i do know that when you are in a deprived sleep state, you are in altered state of consciousness. So, that's a natural high, and I think mixed with or without hypnosis (which is real), that was the cause of my hallucination.  It wasn't really awesome, it was just odd. So anyway, you don't have to have absinthe or acid if you want to hallucinate or any drug...just stay up a real time. Or see a psychiatrist for programming, a pay per visit kinda will oftern honor your request.
