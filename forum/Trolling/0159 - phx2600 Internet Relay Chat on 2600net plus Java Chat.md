20080726-195744 -ChanServ- [#phx2600] All hacking is, is augmenting something from its as-is condition into a different condition so it may be put to use in an alternate scenario, like how a lumberjack turns a tree into lumber for a house, thus 'hacking'. It isn't about what one knows or doesn't know, it is about one's dedication and merit of their efforts.

Anyone is welcome to come chat it up. Try to leave your ego at the door, thanks.

Where: &quot;mynewscreenname&quot; is where you type your new screen name to use.

(Most sensible people use either pugwash or madjack.)

Collective is currently acting as a dumpster for extra people.

BTW:

You can use <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mibbit.com/">http://mibbit.com/</a><!-- m --> to get to 2600net using Javascript's AJAX stuff as a web browser's http-based proxy.
