## Phx2600 is representing
Posted by **XlogicX** on Fri June 15th, 2012 07:15:05 AM

A non-Defcon subforum :o

Who's going? Looks like we will have some representation at this one:

> Network Anti-Reconnaissance: Messing with Nmap Through Smoke and Mirrors
> Dan “AltF4” Petro
>
> Reconnaissance on a network has been an attacker’s game for far too long.
> Where’s the defense? Nmap routinely evades firewalls, traverses NATs, bypasses
> signature-based NIDS, and gathers up the details of your highly vulnerable box
> serving Top Secret documents. Why make it so easy? This talk will explore how
> to prevent network reconnaissance by using honeyd to flood your network with
> low fidelity honeypots. Dan will then discuss how this lets us constrain the
> problem of detecting reconnaissance such that a machine learning algorithm can
> be effectively applied. (No signatures!) Some important additions to honeyd
> will also be discussed along with a live demonstration of Nova, a free
> software tool for doing all of the above.

> Explosive Steganography
> Eric Davisson aka XlogicX, Jesse Hamberger aka MedicineStorm
>
> Encryption makes information secret, steganography hides the information in
> plain sight. We fancy hiding it in a “pile” that most people would avoid. Eric
> and Jesse explore hiding steganography in mediums such as archive exploders,
> file carving exploders, and virus files. They plan to release their open-
> source tools: eZIPlode/asour, magicbomb/-asour, and hivasour/hivsneeze.

Although, MedicineStorm unfortunately won't be able to make it due to personal
reasons, but hopefully his inspiration will still live through the talk.

Anyway, if anybody here is going, come to our talks please ;) . Some of us have
already seen ALTF4's talk at BSidesPHX, and if you haven't, this will be a good
2nd chance, especially since he states it's new and improved. It was honestly my
favorite talk out of the ones I saw at BSidesPHX. At the same conference, I gave
a 3rd of my HOPE content in a talk, but...lol, nobody was there. This is because
I didn't get the chance to tell anybody I was talking at BSides since I found
out I was giving the talk the morning of.
