## The president just awakened repressed memories.

I was listening to the president talk about something or other business related and he mentioned Steve Case which made me think of mid 90s AOL which reminded me of the days when we would call up the 800 numbers to have them send out free floppy disks which made me think of that scene in Hackers where it was taking Joey forever(at least the amount of time to smoke a cigarette) to download about something that was obviously no more than 1.44MB which stopped at about 50%, which happened to make me think of Bring It On and which Made me think of Spiderman 3 and Mary Jane's horrible Southern accent.
