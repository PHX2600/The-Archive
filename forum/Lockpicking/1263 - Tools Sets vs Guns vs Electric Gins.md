## Tools Sets vs Guns vs Electric Gins
Posted by **Ghostshell** on Tue July 6th, 2010 03:11:43 PM

I know tools take more skill, hand gun is manual while electric is self
explanatory. Now the question, manual or electric? I will get a regular tool set
as well.

Any comments or tips on bump keys?

Never had much luck with any of those super lock pick tools like bump keys or
guns.

Standard pick set always seems to do the trick, and if you're doin-it-right its
usually just as fast or faster than those other silly tools.

Less noisy too.

Lock Picks FTW, guns electric or manual have their downsides. Especially when
you get into more challenging key ways. Bump keys work off the same principle as
pick guns, and again they are working on fewer locks. It depends on your goal
and application really, but lock picks can do it all. They take a little more
practice but that is what separates the men from the boys. I am guessing in
computer terms its like script kiddies vs. hackers. I can teach anyone to bump a
lock in about 1 min and anyone to pick a lock in about 1 hour.
