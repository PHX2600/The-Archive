## Battlestar Galactica: Razor
Posted by **dxh** on Thu June 18th, 2009 11:27:31 PM

I got the Battlestar Galactica season 4 DVD recently, which included Razor as a bonus, making the Razor DVD I got last year redundant.  Here's a full description of the film: [url:rw1cxadm]http&#58;//en&#46;wikipedia&#46;org/wiki/Razor_(Battlestar_Galactica)[/url:rw1cxadm]

Even if you don't like Battlestar Galactica, Tricia Helfer makes out with Michelle Forbes in it, making it awesome!  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) --> 

$5 or a large latte at the next 2600 meeting (August will be my next).

I'll buy you a drink next meeting for it.

I loved BSG.  This movie was kind of lacking, but it was still decent.

Are you going to be at the August meeting and does this deal still stand?

Aye and Aye.  I will also be at Defcon too, so if you'd like I can deliver it in Vegas.
