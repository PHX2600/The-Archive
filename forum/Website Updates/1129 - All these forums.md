## All these forums

Hey there.  I see this in a lot of forums, but I don't see the point in having
multiple divisions that could be merged together when there would be no loss if
there was less.  Too many forum divisions can effectively undermine user
activity.

For example, Media and Hacker News could be combined.  It also seems General
Discussion and Off Topic should be combined, or at least put closer together.
In fact, why not just merge Media, Hacker News, Off Topic, and General
discussion together  while you're at it?

Since this is a hacker forum, divisions regarding Security, Hardware, Code, and
Phreaking tend to make sense.  But the other stuff just seems more like clutter
to me.

Anyway. Something for you to think about.
