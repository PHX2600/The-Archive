Next meeting is a week AFTER Defcon, so I expect there to be some good stories!  I'm planning on being there with the wife and baby again, so I'll see everyone there!

Anyone here willing to barter for their Defcon CD and / or schedule? They ran out of both and I never got one. I have last year's Defcon goodies, as well as more assorted stickers, or maybe even just cash.

Eh I don't want to trade them, but I'll be happy to make you copies or something in return for l00tz of equal value.

A copy of the disk would be cool. There are a couple of the presentations that I wanted to check the slides out for. An original is not necessary. I will try to bring l00tz of equal or greater value. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> I will be the guy with spikey hair and a red stickered-out laptop. Don't be shy... though I usually am.

I should have an extra of each, if I do I'll bring 'em to the meet.

I have a copy of the CD on my system, so those of you with media can duplicate.

Sorry I had to split and not make the IHOP post-meeting hangout. Next month, I swears!  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) --> 

And, big thanks to Phlak for the CD+ schedule. I wasn't prepared to give anything in return, I'll try to come up with something for next meet. 

It was good hanging with you guys again!
