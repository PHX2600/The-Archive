## Official PHX2600 BlackBerry Messenger Group
Posted by **PHLAK** on Tue October 20th, 2009 09:10:28 PM

With the recent release of BlackBerry Messenger 5.0 for most BlackBerry smart phone models, I have set up for all of us an official PHX2600 group.  What does this BBM group offer you, you ask?  Well, aside from the ability to share photos, calendar events and task lists, the BBM groups main feature is collaborative chat rooms where we can talk smack and hack all day long, even when you're away from your computer.

For those of you lucky enough to own a BlackBerry, but haven't yet upgraded to BBM 5.0, I must ask, what are you waiting for?!  Seriously!  It's a tremendous leap ahead of the old messenger with features such as contact avatars, online contact backup, 2D barcode identification and more!  You can (and should) check it out from your PC or download it OTA from your BlackBerry here: [url:21bcw1wn]http&#58;//appworld&#46;blackberry&#46;com/webstore/content/3729[/url:21bcw1wn]

Ok, this is all fun and great, now I'm sure you're wondering how to sign up.  Well, once you've upgraded to BBM 5.0, select the &quot;Scan a Group Barcode&quot; option and scan the following barcode, it's that easy!  Hope to see you there.

Is RIM paying you to advertise their products or is this just some kind of flagrant fan boy thing you've got going on here, just curious.

I hope you're getting paid.


*EDIT*

your post brought this to mind.

It said that it failed and that the invite expired or was taken. :&lt;

Weird.  I sent you a direct invite.

The direct invite worked, scanning the barcode was what failwhale'd.
