## Apple is a bad loser
Posted by **XlogicX** on Thu November 10th, 2011 04:59:25 AM

In their new version of iOS, they cut corners to speed software up by opening up
the sandbox a little; allowing a little unsigned code in small corners of
memory, no big deal.

A researcher exploits this with a proof of concept and explains it to apple,
they revoke him from the developer program. Sounds to me like he was doing a
pretty good job...meh, I don't have an iPhone.

Didn't DeVry try to pull this same crap with you until Dr Miller called down the
righteous thunder upon their spines?

Loosely themed, in the sense that I did some "unappreciated" whitehat hacking.
Methods and types of hacks different though. But just as infuriating. I coerced
it into a somewhat happy ending though. I guess I haven't super publicly told
that story on forums or anything, for those interested, there may be an old
episode of RFA out there, I talk about it on that show.

That would be [RFA 87](http://www.oldskoolphreak.com/rfa/rfa87.mp3) and
[RFA 97](http://www.oldskoolphreak.com/rfa/rfa97.mp3). </Feeling like Jason

Digging through some old files, it looks like I scanned the original "Hearing
Results" way back in '03. The results were still crazy for what I did. I argued
nearly every charge as either being redundant or completely incorrect. There was
maybe one charge that I would agree with on technicality. I completely wouldn't
back down on "tampering;" they had to fold on that one.

Anyway, I sanitized it a little to get rid of some of the specific names
involved (including my own, even though it's no big secret). But I made sure to
sanitize the names of the staff at the school (I don't want to re-live anything
or have backlash, lol).

And so these insane charges against me, to put into context (briefest summary
I've ever given). They had a database with most of our sensitive information.
Username was our studentID (also NT login, print queue much?), password was last
4 digits (yes ID was all numbers) of login, webpage was http (no 's'), and even
changing of the password (optional) didn't have a masked field (should surfers,
eyes off the keyboard, look at the screen).

What did I do, I "proof-of-concepted" 3 of my friends (they were cool with it, I
even took one of them to the hearing with me). Mind you, I didn't change
anything, just printed the landing page after login, of which had no PII. I
Immediately gave the print-out to a respected and trusted professor (and she
positively proved her integrity in the events that unfolded).

Now I want more info, seeing as I attended (and graduated from) DeVry.  Maybe we
can discuss this more next meeting.

Sure thing, it did change the way I felt about the institution. Although, I
still do think that the education that I got during the time period was high
quality.
