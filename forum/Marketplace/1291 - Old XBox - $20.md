## Old XBox - $20
Posted by **dxh** on Sun September 12th, 2010 11:41:18 PM

I have an old XBox from 2004 that I haven't touched since I got my 360 Elite in
2006.  It works and is perfect for modding/hacking.  I'm including:

  * XBox
  * Power cable
  * Two controllers

I can bring this to the next HeatSync Labs or PHX2600 meeting.
