So I was wondering; if Rax were able to get his projector to the meeting, if Urbal would want to make another attempt at the Defcon 19 SE CTF results presentation. The hosts of the Social-Engineer.org podcast were bragging about their new member (Urbal) and how good of a report he wrote, and how he was even going to present it at his local 2600 meeting in Phoenix...

Urbal did a really good job on the write up too, so hopefully Rax got his car situation fixed (sounds like that sucked btw) and that Urbal still wants to give it another go.

Oh, and there is a small chance of Evil1 at this next meeting. See you all there.

Yeah, I'm totally down to do it again. Rax, can you confirm the projector will be present?

Attempting to contact Rax.  Will report back if I hear anything from him.

EDIT: Rax is planning on attending (assuming no more garden tool incidents) and will bring the projector.

Making my way to Portland, Oregon in the next ten days or so (Hopefully it's not ridiculously snowy there, yet). 

But yar, will in all liklihood miss this meeting, too. :-/ Any chance of getting a copy of the slides?

I believe this is what it's all going to based on:

Urbal can correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm under the impression that he had a lot to do with this report. I'm looking forward to this in a presentation form and am sure the discussion will be great too.

BTW, the podcast at social-engineer.com is fantastic, take a listen if you haven't already.

ArchAngel - Yes, you can have the slides after the presentation, email me or PM me here.

The slides are based on the report linked by XlogicX. I did the majority of the analysis and a lot of the editing for the official report. I also participated in the contest (prior to joining WHD aka Social-Engineer.org/.com) so I have intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the contest itself.

I anticipate the presentation will be more of a group discussion type thinggy. <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->

It was a good presentation...and on the note of Oracle failing the hardest to SE, they fail at their own product too:
