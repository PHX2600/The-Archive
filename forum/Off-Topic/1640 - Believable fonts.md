Apparently people are more apt to believe what they read when composed in certain fonts. Georgia is the most believable. Baskerville is the least.

Yea, but actually look at the numbers on those graphs. They are almost identical values. Not at all what the bars seem to indicate. Probably not far from the margin of error.

Good observation.  Looking at it more closely, it all seems statistically insignificant.
