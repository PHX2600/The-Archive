Sounding off per twitter request.

Something to share? Well <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://techphx.com/schedule/">http://techphx.com/schedule/</a><!-- m --> has recordings of &quot;many&quot; of the sessions (it's that conference I volunteer at).

I've been wondering about how best to utilize my twitter account when considering: &quot;the internet allows us to connect with other people from all over the globe to talk about our passions and geek out on a topic and a chance to speak with peers because no one else in your town is into xyz&quot; vs &quot;the internet allows really specific local information to be shared about people / places / things, and a chance to meet people that don't share your interests but can become valuable assets when you need a reference or information about a topic of which you are not familiar&quot;.

Perhaps the answer is two twitter accounts? One devoted to all topics but local, and the other devoted to a specific subject but world wide.

I've been in Az now for almost a year.  Keep meaning to head out.  If I can't catch the meeting tomorrow, will definitely try for February.
