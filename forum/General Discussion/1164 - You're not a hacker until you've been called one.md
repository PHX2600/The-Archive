## You're not a hacker until you've been called one!
Posted by **Valveritas** on Wed December 2nd, 2009 06:14:21 PM

I had a short conversation online with this woman about hackers and 2600 recently.   

[quote:1srivjt2]
A great deal of the articles are nonsensical. And I agree, most people who claim they are hackers are script kiddies, and anyone else who claims they are a hacker are contradicting the very definition of the word. For hackers one never gets the privileged to call himself a hacker, that title is bestowed upon him by others. Someone who 'hacks' isn't in turn a 'hacker'.  [/quote:1srivjt2]


I didn't actually say that I thought most hackers are script kiddies, but that there are many people that pose as hackers, but don't actually hack anything.  I don't know what she means by "contradicting the very definition of the word."  If you hack, even if it's poorly and you're just a beginner, I see no problem in thinking of yourself as or calling yourself a hacker.   This doesn't mean you're a good hacker of course, but you're still hacking... and if you're hacking, you're a hacker.  The same would apply to any others pursuits, like skeeing.  If you ski, you're a skier.  I don't understand this pretentious "title" stuff either.   Has anyone been knighted as a hacker at one point?   I've had other people call me a hacker, but I've never really had a another hacker say "hey dude, I grant you the title of HaCkEr! You're one of us now!"

And I wasn't aware that most of the articles in 2600 are nonsensical.  It's been while since I've read any 2600 articles, but I don't remember this being the case.

Anyway, she also said this:

[quote:1srivjt2]
Hacking is a Guru complex. I know a great deal of people who hack into security systems and obnoxious 'hackers' accounts simply for saying that they're a hacker.[/quote:1srivjt2]

I've never experienced this.  I can't think of any hacker that did this simply to say they were a hacker, but rather because they felt a drive to hack.  And because it was fun.

Any thoughts you non-hackers?  <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

Some time ago I tried to come up with my own definition of the word "hacker", not liking those others presented.  I eventually did and that definition has evolved over time into this:

[quote:1mlv0avl]Hacker [hack·er] /n/ - Someone who seeks to understand the details of a system and how to stretch it's capabilities beyond the original intent.[/quote:1mlv0avl]

With this definition, hacking is not defined by any one task in particular, but can be applied to any activity from hardware hacking (integrated circuits, phreaking, making) and software hacking (programming, exploiting) to people hacking (social engineering) and although it typically isn't, could even be applied to activities like knitting or dancing.

When you get down to it, everyone is a "hacker" in their own way, some people are just more of the typical hacker (read Zero Cool) than others and many people don't even realize they're hackers at all.  It's our (self-proclaimed hackers) job to open these peoples eyes and show them they're not alone.


PS - HACK THE PLANET!!!

I think that definition makes a lot of sense PHLAK.  Approved for mass consumption.  ;P

I have a "HACK"saw when I use it that makes me a "HACKER"
Seriously do any of us do what we do for the title?
I think we do what we do for the fact that we love what we do.
Call me a hacker, a maker , a nerd or an asshole I'm not gonna stop doing what i do no matter what the title is.

Wait wait wait! Are you saying we're NEVER going to get knighted "Hacker" no matter how many scripts we download? How will we ever satisfy our all-motivating guru complex now?

You are what you do. If you hack stuff, then you're a hacker. If you don't, then you're not. I think it's pretty simple.

But there is a grain of truth to sentiments in the OP, I would contend. Being a hacker isn't something that you accidentally do. It takes time, ability, and effort. To have someone call you a hacker is a compliment (in the correct context). It's a vindication of the time and effort you've spent. It's someone else acknowledging your ability and knowledge. So to call yourself one is a risky proposition if you can't back it up.

EDIT: But more to the point of what Medicine Storm said, you can't have a guru complex about it. Yearning for the label of "hacker" is not the way. That will only lead you to be a kiddie, even if you've fooled everyone else. It's like being a great scientist. If all you want is to obtain the label of "great scientist", then you will inevitably fail. Your motivations have to be something else.

I like that a lot and agree fully.  Too many people want the label of "hacker" but don't want to do the work or obtain the knowledge for themselves.  They just want the metaphorical "Hack It" button.

Very well said AltF4.  Usually when I talk to someone I just say I programmed this thing, or found a glitch / bug here. There's often a problem with mentioning the term Hacker or Hacking with "normal" people, as it conjures misleading images for them depending on their prejudices.   Most people either think you're a super-hero or an asshole criminal.  Then there's also a segment of the population I've come into contact with that think all hackers are like santa claus and the easter bunny, and that they don't really exist.  That always makes me chuckle.

Conversely there are people out there that do NOT want the title of "hacker" but are, without a doubt, hackers despite.

A friend of ours was describing to us how much fun he had modifying an old rotary phone so he could use it with his blackberry. We referred to him as a hacker, but he responded "Oh, no no no. I'm not a hacker... I just like to experiment with stuff and see if I can get it to do things that it wasn't really meant to do." 
"Um, yeah. Like it or not, you' a HACKER! Embrace it or cope with it."

Good discussion, lots of very good points/examples.
Here's a question, though -- how does one differentiate between a hacker and a script kiddie?  Or is it possible to be both?
F'rinstance, someone who knows how things (are supposed to) work, but copies/downloads/whatever other people's scripts/utilities/etc to use because he or she can't or doesn't want to create or write their own?  Can they be properly termed a hacker?

This is kinda of funny, I have been called a hacker so many times, but I do not consider myself a hacker at, whatsoever, I don't know how to write code or hack into systems. I am kinda good at social engineering and I can pick a lock or 2. But all I do is use other peoples methods. I use other peoples codes and cracks. I don't even use scripts. Hacker is perception. I can root a phone here or there, using other peoples codes and methods, but I couldn't do one from scratch myself.

So, am I a hacker? Because I do not consider myself as such.

There was a time when the word "hacker" was a bad word, (around that same time a 28.8 bps modem was fast) but it was relative to who was using it.  Remember the Hacker vs Cracker thing?  Does that still apply?  I haven't really kept up to date with haX0r jargon lately.  Take the term "Cracker" Crackers were the bad people who broke into computers, and made viruses, and/or they were the people who defeated the copyright protection on software, or just white people in general. <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: -->   But anyway, at what point did hacking become synonymous with slightly modifying anything whatsoever.  It's like put a piece of tape on some object and you just hacked it.   See how the news calls "Anonymous" a group of hackers?  lol  So anyways I guess the point I was making is that it doesn't matter if you're called a hacker or meatspinner or whatever if you have to tell people what you are for them to know what you are, then you probably aren't so much of that thing you "are". Is?    

I don't know, I haven't slept in a about 26 hours

Makes sense to me.
