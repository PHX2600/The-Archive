## Profile of a hacker forum
Posted by **XlogicX** on Sat October 22nd, 2011 04:38:48 AM

Security researchers did an analysis on "hacker forums" to try to profile what we are up to. This study really demonstrates how out of touch they really are with hacker communities at large. It seems like these are the same people that would think that hackers are behind things like Zues and Stuxnet (and the new DuQu). The underground economy of cybercrime is very competitive (if not overtaking) the drug underground economy. These research seem to think that hackers are the drug lords when we are in fact just the chemists (and for fun, not profit).

I digress. This report also shows how out of touch the business side security community has been for so long. The types of discussions they find shocking on hacker forums have been around since the BBS days ("how to hack" guides, social engineering guides, and law enforcement avoidance). Textfiles.com is an easy source to demonstrate that this general theme of sharing information has been around for more than a quarter of a century, but we all knew this.

Anyway, here's the study for those interested:

Hah, (emphasis mine):

recruitment, commerce **and even social interaction.**[/quote:sa67gk87]
Reminds me of "We'll be fine so long as they don't learn how to open doors".

I don't know why they try to hide the place they're studying with phrases like "one of the largest-known hacker forums with roughly 250,000 members", though; they apparently were just lurking around hackforums(dot)net. Which, incidentally, only has 226,735 members -- and who knows how many of those are active, alternate accounts, bots, other security researchers, etcetera. *shrugz*

Yeah, their findings either seemed illegitimate, or if there was any validity to parts of it, you were left wondering why they were surprised by those findings (as the culture has been around for ages).

While I'm not fond of comparing hackers to drug dealers/makers, I like this analogy.

Jackasses...
If they just ASKED how to better protect themselves from hacking by _posting on our forums_ they would get much more direct answers than _studying our forums_. Who among us would not jump at the opportunity to help a curious poster guard against the very attacks we discuss?
