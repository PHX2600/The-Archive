## Reversing
Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Sat May 9th, 2009 08:12:54 PM

Anyone else here enjoy the challenge of reversing (reverse engineering / debugging) software?

I know NaK used to do some encrypting using XOR and stuff but I
think hes dead now, pretty sure they found him dead in flagstaff after a bad toad licking endeavor .

Just trying to stir up some conversation.

I haven't ever tried reverse engineering hardware, I once saw a video of a guy who was reversing a smart card or something using acids and super small probes that was intense.

Edit*

FOUND IT
