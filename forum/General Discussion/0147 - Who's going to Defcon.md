## Who's going to Defcon?
Posted by **linker** on Sat July 12th, 2008 12:44:56 PM

[i:2yzn73dm]Hello[/i:2yzn73dm], 

I'm heading up to Defcon again this year and the group of guys I've normally gone with the past few are either not able to go or have had things come up (no $) and can't go. Anyways, I was curious as to who is going up there this year from the Phoenix area. I'm flying up, but it'd be nice to have a group to hang out with or BS with in between lectures.

I have a friend that lives in Vegas that I haven't seen in quite a while. I'll probably be spending my free time with him and his wife.

I'll be flying in and meeting the others there.  Coming in from Dallas, that wouldn't be a pleasant drive. <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->

my parents are coming and a bunch of people that we know from the internets are coming too. for the wedding. so i dont even know what is happening w/ that. like... i doubt they will want to go to defcon. unless they are looking for someone to fix their computer or something.

Yeah. I want to go, but at the same time I didnt plan shit like an idiot. I guess I can fly in or bus there, but i'd be sleeping on the streets.

I want to go bad but there are so many tools I still want to buy. If I get some extra swag I have been waiting for I might just spring the funds for a summer holiday.

I reserved a double occupancy room and it appears that I probably won't need it. It's reserved for Thursday, Friday and Saturday night and the first night+taxes have already been put up. At least one coworker wants to go and will probably want to use it, but we should be able to put some more folks in there. Send me a PM if you're interested in getting in on it. Not sure how many places to sleep there will be so be prepared to make do. Special consideration to individuals willing to give my coworker a ride. <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

I'd let you stay with me, but I only got a king bed and when I called that's all they had left. Sorry man, Ugly sounds like he might have some room.

Where is it your coming from Ugly? Where are you staying? I remember a couple years back at the alexis, I had a room and there were 4 other guys staying. I told them they could stay if they didn't mind sleeping on the floor and they busted out sleeping bags.

I'm either staying with a friend at the Riv or with a friend that lives in Vegas. I reserved the room long before these plans fell into place so I figured I'd make it available to others rather than canceling it straight away. I'm driving myself up from Phoenix; it's a coworker of mine that needs a ride. I don't have a spot in my truck for him. Since I'm not staying in the room, I don't care if people are bunked up in sleeping bags. <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

So the total for that room with taxes and fees for 3 nights is going to be around $300. I've already payed the first night's fee+taxes ($108) leaving a little less than $200.  I need to get confirmations from those planning to stay in it so I can work out the individual costs.

If I don't get at least one taker to split the cost with my coworker by the week before the con, I'm going to post it in the defcon forums. I'm sure someone there will jump on it quickly. Worst case I cancel the reservation that Monday and get a refund.
