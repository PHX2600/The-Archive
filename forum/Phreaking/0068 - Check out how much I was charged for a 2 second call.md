## Check out how much I was charged for a 2 second call
Posted by **nak** on Thu February 21st, 2008 10:06:47 AM

... I got a visa gift card from Cingular (yeah it was a while back) for selling
their phones, and I was curious as to how the credit card payment on COCOTs
worked... (slide card, enter zip code... etc)

![](http://www.wetwarehacks.com/payphone_charge.jpg)

I don't know why there's a 10 dollar charge, the card was worth 50 dollars, now
its $42.62 ... so the $10 didn't go through or something  :?:

I was just cleaning my room and ran across the card again finally, it sucked
missing fiddy bucks for so long.

This also reminds me of using an old best buy gift card to purchase a locker at
the airport o.o

Oh yeah for sure, I've checked that out and bought a bunch of the magstripe
readers off allelectronics when they had 'em for cheap, sold kits at defcon for
like 5 bucks, it was totally sweet.

What I really need is a magstripe writer to do some magstripe fuzzing ... lol

The $10 was just a verification of funds. What this means, however, is that if
you get a prepaid VISA with just $10.01 on it, you might be able to rack up a
$30 bill.
