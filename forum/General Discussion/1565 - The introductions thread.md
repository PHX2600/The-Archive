Hi Nak,

I'm a Human Male, Caucasian, ~5'10'' on a good day.
Brown hair, blue eyes and I love to take long walks along the C shore to find Shell scripts.
My Zodiac sign is Gemini which is sweet since Gemini man is without a doubt one of the best Megaman bosses.

For a full bio please review this character video <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/vcr_homsar.html">http://www.homestarrunner.com/vcr_homsar.html</a><!-- m -->

Well... I'm PHLAK.

I'm a web geek by trade and am the maintainer of the phx2600.org site and server.  I use Linux as my primary working machine but keep Windows on my home machine so I can enjoy some good PC gaming. I try to make it to as many meetings as possible but miss one every now and then.  If you want to know anything else, feel free to ask.

Hi, I'm *Chesy ("CHEH-zee"), and I generally prefer to do a lot more listening and asking questions than talking. This is possibly because I understand programming and websites, but haven't done more than dabbled in that stuff. I can get around on most popular OSes, but I wish I was as proficient in Linux as I am in Windows (XP). Windows 8 (by repelling) and Android (by attracting) may motivate/nudge me out of my comfort zone.

My favorite computer game is still Minesweeper.

My netbook used to dual-boot WinXP and Linux, now it dual-boots WinXP and Mac. Hopefully I'll get it to triple-boot soon. Or quad-boot (w/FreeDOS, or something else). Why? Just because, to see if it can be done.

*but Kilo calls me "Teach"

Welcome Chesy!  Good luck with learning Linux.  If you have any questions regarding Linux, many of us (including my self) can likely help you find an answer.  There's a meeting this Friday, you should stop on by.

I've come probably ~75% of the time over the past few years, depending on what else I have going on. I'll be there this Friday, possibly with a guest.

Hello all I am Wook 

I picked that name up playing MMOs a long time ago ( at almost Seven feet and 400lbs the name really stuck). I am an SCM, Configuration Manager by trade. The job pretty much lends itself to cobbling together someones code into a working product. Elevated privileges, a large diverse Corporate Network and really sloppy security got me interested in security.  I look forward to coming to the July meet and I will be going to Defcon for the first time this year. I have wanted to for years  but my previous company always had a major release planned during the con.

My name is Dizzy. I am a Datacenter Gnome from the area. I'm hitchhiking to DEFCON with the help of kind strangers and having them post pictures of my travels to my [url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dizzy-The-Datacenter-Gnome/423097177729156:kpz724ym]Facebook page>.

I've asked to find my way back to your group when I'm done. If I get there, please let Ugly know.
