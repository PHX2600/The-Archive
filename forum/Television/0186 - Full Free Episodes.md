## Full Free Episodes!!!!
Posted by **Ghostshell** on Wed August 6th, 2008 10:09:39 AM

Since late 2006 any TV company minus ones such as Showtime and HBO started using Flash to add streaming videos (TV episodes) of their shows that they air on TV. In the beginning there were only a few TV shows that were listed and some episodes posted and took atleast 1-2 days after the day they were aired to get posted. Now any company has all there most popular shows full episodes on their site and are posted within 24hours of being aired. The quality and speed of the streams improved as well. Below is a list of sites that i like to inhabit. there may be more as I do not watch everything. All sites are simular, just look got full episodes, TV shows or Video and you should be able to locate all  the shows easily.

I would like to recoment two shows that you may have to DL unless you have access to EZTV via Winamp or anyother streaming app. But you cam find some good torrents on eztv.it, mainly TV shows only.

Generation Kill - on S01E04 - on every Sunday night
The Weeds - on S01E08 - on every Monday night
