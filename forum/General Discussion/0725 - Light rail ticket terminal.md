## Light rail ticket terminal
Posted by **dual** on Mon January 19th, 2009 11:47:39 PM

Took the light rail to see The Lion King (vapid-waste-of-money-Osamu-Tezuka-Kimba-the-White-Lion-Lion-ripoff) and swore I heard the windows sound at the station. Got to the ticket terminal and found the source of the magical sound. The ticket machine was in a wonderful reboot loop, apparently since the night before per a nice young lady. It was functioning when we returned later that evening.

Hopefully, the light rail itself doesn't crash as quickly.  The thing passes right in front of my apartment complex.  It might make me late for work. <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->
