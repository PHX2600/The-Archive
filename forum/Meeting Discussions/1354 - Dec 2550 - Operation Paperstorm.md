## Dec 2550 - Operation Paperstorm
Posted by **AltF4** on Fri December 17th, 2010 07:26:31 PM

Sorry for the late announcement, but Saturday is Operation Paperstorm and we need your help! It's going to be one of the busiest Christmas shopping days of the year tomorrow, and the masses need to be informed. Hit them in the real world, hit them with information. WikiLeaks needs your support, Freedom of Information needs your support.

The basic idea is to print out as many fliers as possible and post them in conspicuous places wide eyed shoppers will be able to read them. So we need you to print out as much as you can come meet up with us:

Printing materials:
