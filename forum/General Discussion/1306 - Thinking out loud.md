## Thinking out loud!!!
Posted by **ThatGuy** on Tue October 19th, 2010 07:57:06 PM

This is just me thinking out loud but it seems like there is very little discussion on the forum, or an influx of new members. Is there not enough advertising or public knowledge of 2600? There seems to be enough new content to keep it going but a lack of new blood. Maybe a little more presence at schools that encourage the open atmosphere, or is best the way it is? From what I have been catching up on it just seems like the information isn’t getting out there.  Don’t get me wrong the people I have meet have been awesome and very welcoming especially because I am into physical security which sort of makes me like a red headed step child in the security genre for the hacker moniker used to describe 2600 members. 
I can still remember the first meet I attended vividly. Things that made the first meeting a little unnerving was I didn’t know who where 2600 people or just regular customers in the coffee shop. I simply asked a few people who were sitting around me if the they where there for the 2600 meet. Luckily the first person I asked was a member. I guess I was early even though I was there a little after  the posted meet time. For me it was cool and inviting once people rolled in and I had my briefcase of goodies. It’s what kept me wanting to go even though I live almost 1:30 away. It was that everyone was so cool. The atmosphere was great and I really enjoy showing people exploits, techniques, tools or just talking about physical security in general. I guess it’s why most people attend 2600 meets.
The thing to remember is that it all started for me online. I didn’t even know that PHX had a 2600 group. I found it through the Defcon website via several e-mails to Defcon 602 and some other AZ Defcon groups who where inactive. I only received one e-mail response who directed me towards PHX2600. From there I started researching on the forum , and you still don’t have an intro thread! This is just some food for thought if you want to attract new members or let people know that you are here, you meet, and do exist in PHX. Not to mention you guys represent a wide variety of information and have many extremely knowledgeable people in many fields of interest. I think places like UAT, or ASU would be great places to gain more members. Just my 2¢

3rded.

On that note, we do have some [url=http://www.phx2600.org/archive/2009/09/20/phx2600-meeting-flyers/:1sp4mbxi]flyers available to print>.  I don't live/work near ASU, so it would be great if anyone who does ***COUGHPENGUINCOUGH*** could post these around or hand them out.  Also, don't limit posting these to just ASU, hit up some local coffee shops, etc.  I have another design I like better that fits 4 per page and has a QR code, I'll try to find that again and post it for use.

These fliers are massively out of date and list wrong information *COUGHPHLAKCOUGH*

Fix em up then I would be happy to spread the propaganda.

Oops... didn't realize that.  Yeah, the other flyer I mentioned doesn't specify a location, just says to check the website for location.  I'll try to get that one up over lunch.

QR code rather than bar code on flyers, please.

I guess it'll have to say "see web site for meeting location" since there's no new "regular" meeting spot (yet).

Ok, new flyer is now available:

Penguin what do you do at ASU? I currently work there and can probably help out if needed with flyers by coming in an hour or so early and hitting some billboards.

I printed out dozens last year and put them all over the Brickyard. But now I'm all graduated...

New members are always awesome. But what I think we really need are more organized 2600 events. The meetings are great, but we always seem to kind of just sit around and talk. Which is awesome. I love talking to you guys. But it would be good if we had a "Phx 2600 sponsored game of CTF" or "Phx 2600 soft/hardware projects". 

Maybe we can have a "show off your pet project month". (People are always so hesitant to show their projects until their done)

Correct sir!

I believe you are spot on with your diagnosis.

Having more regular presentations would be a great attraction and benefit. I can present some embedded hardware stuff and maybe some ham-radio related stuff. I also have some python projects which might be worth looking at.

I know logic has some pretty sweet assembly stuff going on that I would love to see presented. and ALMIGHTY ADMIN PHLAK can show us some SEO or web dev stuff.

Maybe RAX could give a presentation on looking pretty  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) --> or maybe just a  presentation on the p2p internet infrastructure in the works. If we could get into that as a group and host one of the new P2P DNS nodes it would be sweet.

I was also considering a hacker style swap-meet to raise money for the hacker space. Rax and I raised 50 dollars last meet just selling off some unused items I had. If we could all donate our unused goods I bet we could raise enough to really get this show on the road.

As a side note all the items I posted in the market place area are being sold to benefit the hacker space. All sales go to a fund to help get the hacker space started.

I'll plop some fliers up around campus today. I would like to see some thought about maybe moving the meetings to a larger venue which is open later and might allow soldering equipment and projectors for presentations. At least until we have our own place to move into.

i agree 
also fine tuning some other fund raising ideas i have for the hacker space 
we need to bring back the online meeting in regards to the hacker space which i have been guilty of missing too
having a set goal would be a much easier way to make this happen 
would love a good lesson on seo as this is something that we have been discussing at work 
do you have a ham license penguin? cause if so i never know you were into this we could have been sharing ideas and other radio stuff a while ago

Kilo Echo Seven Victory Mike Quebec, That's me!

I have a dual band HT 2Meter/440 and a 2meter base station.

Tech license so no HF stuff or large masts or anything nutty.

We could do radio meet ups once a week on 2 meter. plenty of repeaters in the phoenix metro area, even some with auto-patches, we could dial into a party line and cross the ham-phreak barrier. Might piss off the repeater operator though.

Licenses are cheap as fuck now only 14 bucks and I passed mine without even studying. Hell they don't even require you to learn CW anymore!

Ham is also good for everyone preparing for the zombie invasion or nuclear apocalypse.

Whats your call sign? if you don't mind publishing it on these scary hacker forums that is.


EDIT:
Here's a sweet map I made of repeaters I can hit from my place. I included Offsets and PL tones for easy programming.

I could do a quick presentation on a pet project of mine. I mentioned it a while back, but I've actually started coding it now. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> It's a tool for performing a traffic analysis attack on encrypted protocols. You would feed it an encrypted packet capture, and it would spit out what protocols are being used inside. 

It would also be cool to make a counter-tool. Something which shapes your traffic such that it appears to be a different protocol. (IE: Pad packets and send them in intervals such that Bit Torrent traffic looks like Web traffic, or whatever)

I feel like we should have a "Pet Project" room on the forum. 

oh, also. I signed up for the P2P DNS Security / Dev team.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Thu December 9th, 2010 07:27:45 AM

@AltF4

That is sweet, both the tool and the counter-tool would be super fun to see develop. 

What language are you using?

Also make sure you code us a back door in the new p2p dns system  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

Posted by **AltF4** on Thu December 9th, 2010 05:02:12 PM

It's c/c++. The main code is c++, but some of the libraries I need are in c. Dev'ing on my Ubuntu machine, Eclipse CDT.

DOUBLE POST

What about a key signing party? I think that would be a great idea. It's cryptographically important, you know. Set up a 2600 web of trust. If I wanted to send a secure message to one of you guys, being sure of your public keys is the best way. 

Plus it's a nerdy social event. It would give everyone an excuse to introduce themselves to all the strangers at the meeting. Really good for newcomers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Sat December 11th, 2010 10:08:37 AM

Yeah for sure, Key signing and maybe a little primer on how that works in-case some people don't know.

I wonder what the most signed key is these days.

That's awesome!  I'm totally down for this.  Maybe we could roll the DARC poker night / fund raiser in with the key signing party?  Do you know how to set up a public key server so we can have a PHX2600 key server, or do you think it would be better to use a free one like the [url=http://pgp.mit.edu/:39qq29z9]MIT PGP Key Server>?

While we're on the topic of key servers, do you know how to remove your key from the server after having lost the original? I have a few on the MIT key server that I no longer have any more (set them up before I fully understood PGP), and would like to remove those and put up a current one.  **EDIT:** [url=http://pgp.mit.edu/faq.html:39qq29z9]Answered my own question>
