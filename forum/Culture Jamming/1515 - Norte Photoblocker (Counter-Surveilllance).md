## Norte Photoblocker (Counter-Surveilllance)
Posted by **ArchAngel** on Wed December 14th, 2011 08:23:22 PM

This is being advertised as a way to keep your p1x0r from being uploaded
surreptitiously to the facebooks -- but it's an interesting idea for some
culture-jamming, too; I'll let these articles speak for themselves:

wondering if the tech can be reverse-engineered, condensed, and attached to
something innocuous like a baseball cap. Besides wanting one ourself, Anti-
paparazzi hats would sell.

I imagine the hardware is actually fairly small.  It's the battery that you'd
have to worry about being to big.

Fun fact: alkaline batteries all typically run at 1.5 volts. T3h rechargeable
NiCad kind run a little less -- like 1.25 or 1.20 --but if you find out a device
runs on D cells you can h4x0r it to run on an equal number of AAs or AAAs
without much effort. (disclaimer: ArchAngel is not an electrician).

Yep. I found some good spec details a little bit ago here:
<http://www.batterysavers.com/Compare-Batteries.html>

I actually wrote an article for 2600 about battery hacking. Not published yet,
but I did get the confirmation that they would (not to be confused with the
confirmation that they received the article). Because of that, I wont go into
graphic detail, as they tend to not publish when the writer self-publishes
elsewhere first.
