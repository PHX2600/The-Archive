## "Press Button Receive Bacon" America to Middle East Merchant
Posted by **jargon** on Tue November 3rd, 2009 04:20:20 AM

Btw, I set up a the Voxalot account "4BACON" so other hackers in the Sand may be
able to have a softphone account to call into in order to get someone in the
states to help them get BaconSalt etc to them since lots of Americanized
products are banned or difficult to come by in the Middle East.

I plan on having such items as "CocaCola", "Snickers", "BaconSalt", etc as items
I would permit personally routing third party vendors to send to such people in
order for said persons to have someone in the states be able to work with these
various vendors in getting such items shipped and actually arrive.

I would just be a middleman in order to ensure these Americanized products got
to these deserving Westerner infrastructure developers in the Middle East.

"BaconSalt" is one such alternative replacement condiment item to rectify the
lack of pork products in the Middle East.

"CocaCola" and "Snickers" are two food & beverage items that are very difficult
to come by in the Middle East.

The 4BACON "Press Button Receive Bacon" Voxalot account would mostly deal with
foods, beverages, and condiments.

Another item I may route is the condiment paprika, but I haven't yet looked into
how difficult this item is to obtain in the Middle East; I am just very well
aware that many Russian dishes require it.

If anyone is interested in helping out with the "Press Button Receive Bacon"
merchant route, I would be very appreciative of the offers, but this is a pretty
small time operation. ;)

Coca-Cola is actually the most world-wide product.  There's hardly anywhere in
the world you can go without being able to buy a Coke.

This thread is mostly a joke. They can have friends and family such as their
parents send them stuff.

Also, I am not sure that account even is able to field inbound calls.

However, if for inexplicable reasons, I really did somehow receive an inbound
call on it, I might actually send a bottle of BaconSalt due to how much work the
person put into calling the number.

Mexican coke is the best coke.  It uses real sugar, not high fructose corn
syrup.

While I agree with that, it's also ~2 times the price of HFC laden Coke.

because HFCS is subsidized here, it's kind of political actually.

Indeed, corn is subsidized, of which corn syrup is a biproduct.
