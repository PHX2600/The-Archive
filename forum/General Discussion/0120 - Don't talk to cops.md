[quote:dsbkjliv]
An law school professor and former criminal defense attorney tells you why you should never agree to be interviewed by the police.

I think you'll find this worth watching and informative. Although I followed this advice initially when I was arrested when I was a young 19 year old, I didn't follow it throughout the entire process when my attorney relationship broke down.  If I had, it [i:dsbkjliv]may have[/i:dsbkjliv] made a real difference to whether or not I was prosecuted.  Be sure to check out part 2 as well.

This is so relevant.

I got pilled over a while back and the cop was trying to search me and ask me questions that implied I was hold contrband of somekind. I simply danced around his questions by not answering them and when they asked to search my car I politely and respectfully declined. At this point I was issued my ticket allowed to leave.

Always know your rights in any situation involving the police. Whether at your home, walking on the street or driving your car. Especially if you are detained at the police station.

I always like to say, &quot;I am at liberty to not answer that question.&quot;

That cop looked at me and said, &quot;I have to be honest, I think you have drugs in the car.&quot;

And, in my finest moment with law enforcement, without skipping a beat, I looked hime dead in the eye and I said &quot;Well, everybody is entitled to their own opinion.&quot;

Those guys wanted to search me so bad, but I wasn't having it.

Isn't there a set of questions you have to answer? Like identifying yourself?

I don't want to get into details, but I was being questioned by police while I was on foot, they asked if I had an ID, which I didn't have, so they asked questions regarding my ID, gave them my name and address and tried to answer their other questions.

I probably wont take any responses seriously though (unless they have references, lol) as House MD says people LIE.

What is the short answer for how much information you have to give if stopped while driving?

I know text messaging while driving is illegal in Phoenix. I've always wondered how they would handle &quot;I wasn't texting, I was dialing a phone  #&quot;.

Oh this is fun, video clips on how to refuse a search:

This is great information maybe we should have a section on legal advice to include all of this stuff. I just bought that DVD they sell. It would be nice to know the different laws concerning the different aspects in the community as realted to AZ. Like that balloon info Ugly found out concerning his blimp project. I am sure it would help many people from reading the posts about personal experiences that have been posted thus far. The only advice I can give is to get a good attorney, that offers a flat rate fee for services.

I've never been confronted by the police, save a few traffic incidents, however, as I delve deeper and deeper into the hacker/UE universe I find myself closing in on that moment where I will have to.  This information was very helpful, but the one thing I'd love to see (kinda related to ThanGuy's post), is a database of all the local laws that I can search through to determine what I can/cannot do, and hopefully be able to find some legal loop holes in the event something goes wrong.  Does anybody know of anything like this, if so please share!
