## O-Scope?
Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Tue May 5th, 2009 12:06:38 PM

Looking for an O-Scope for some projects I'm working on, probably PC based digital, I need to be able to sample a 20mhz square wave with fair precision.

I don't really want to spend very much anyone have any leads on something like this?

Thanks.

I have a 30Mhz one (which isn't much) if you want to borrow it, I can bring it to the next meeting or a 2550 if that is still happening. Let me know.

No I don't think I want to borrow one I just want to purchase a low end one, maybe used that can do digital sampling and one shot.

I don't want to borrow one because I'm pretty much an O-scope newb and I would hate to have to explain how I didn't know you couldn't use it with voltages over 20k or something  <!-- s:oops: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" /><!-- s:oops: -->

*Edit

Thanks for the offer though!  <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

In that case, ebay and craigslist for cheap I guess. I got mine at fry's electronics. You could also go to the Apache Reclamation, it's around 7th st. and the 10 I think, google it, that place is a hardware porn junkyard, and I know I've seen O-Scopes there too.

that reclamation place is pretty epic, that's true. I remember they had that one side room that had actual WORKING electronics in it and some o-scopes maybe ill check them out.
