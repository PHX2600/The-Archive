Since [url=http://www.phx2600.org/forum2/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=19:26z31fba]no one really answered me> I created a channel on EFnet.  I'll be there off and on, probably as 'phatmlord'.  I may have some stupid script running, so be warned!

Excitement.

I used to be an IRC'r, but not much anymore.  I'll pop in and check it out!

It's making a comeback!  Actually, no... but consider it a 24 hour virtual meeting in which I show and no one is there. 

Wait, that's not right.

I've been connected to IRC for 3 days now, so figured I might as well.

FYI for everyone: most activity seems to be around 9:00pm to 11:00pm or so.

For several days (I think 5?) phigan has been squatting in the channel, saying next to nothing.  When he does type anything it's something like "!@#" or "jej". 

As he obviously knows I set up a channel bot (PhatmLord) to keep the channel going and to set auto-ops.  I have a computer dedicated to this, so I can reboot and not worry about it.   I've asked him nicely to leave the channel temporarily so I can re-establish the bot which got disconnected during a software error many days ago.  However, he's ignored that request, and others.  Basically, it seems ignoring everything around him in the channel is his strongest asset.

While I've been in the channel phigan has been rather immature and disingenuous.  For one, he thinks he's superior because he uses Bitch-X and I use Mirc.  I would like to refer him to the [url=http://www.phx2600.org/guidelines.php:3eon0a5u]appended 2600 rule> as well as rule #1.  Since this channel is related to this site and 2600 I see no reason why it should be governed any other way.

Man, you sure are whiney. I didn't see you ask me to part temporarily the one time that you did. I just checked my lastlog. I haven't been "squatting", I've simply been away from my terminal.

I never said I was superior, and I even told you that you were assuming quite a bit.
This is ALL that I said, I have my entire time in #phx2600 logged..

On the other hand, here's some things you've said..
[quote:3oel77qp]02:17 <CultLeadr:#phx2600> You're sort of a Bitch-X fanboy huh phigan?  Seems
          like a script kiddie app mostly.
02:18 <CultLeadr:#phx2600> If I was running your OS, I'd use irssi.  I don't
          want to have a homosexual canine relationship with a sophomoric
          programmer. Know what I mean?[/quote:3oel77qp]
You were obviously trying to antagonize me.

Goddamn, you're a whiney bitch.

However, you exude arrogance and a superior attitude.

I hope with your new job you find something better to do with your time.  If I was your employer though, I wouldn't hire you.  These are the main reasons:

1.) Can't pay attention
2.) Insults people around him needlessly
3.) Uses slang and gibberish over english

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **phigan** on Fri February 15th, 2008 10:23:28 PM

Yeah, I exude arrogance by telling you your IRC client was written by a homosexual canine, or something to that effect... Oh, wait... no.. that was you.

Or, I exude arrogance by wrongly assuming a bunch of crap about insignificant opinions that you have... Oh, wait... no.. that was you again.

Or, I exude arrogance by pointing out how you use language loosely and have a good time online... OH, WAIT.. Shit, that's you again. Goddamn.

Hmmmm....

And wait, who did I insult needlessly? If you're insulted because I said you're a whiney bitch, too bad. I'm pretty confident in my right to call you that, after your repeated attempts at antagonizing and insulting me.

Haha, you're only showing how petty you are by continuing this.

That wasn't a tantrum, that was my response to the annoying msges you've been sending me.

Are you ready to stop being homosexual?

I mean, it's ok if you actually -are- homosexual, it'd just be nice if you'd stop being so bitchy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Valveritas** on Sat February 16th, 2008 12:02:29 AM

I'd say rather this is showing how petty you are.  The log I just posted is what you sent to me in /msg immediately after you posted.  

My first post in this thread here was not to continue anything, it was to end it.  Obviously you can't do that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **phigan** on Sat February 16th, 2008 07:02:50 AM

Your post was to complain and whine <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> hence the "WAAA"

This has gotten off topic.  Flaming will not be tolerated, consider this a warning to you both, Phigan and CultLeadr.
