## Spring time in Arizona
Posted by **AltF4** on Sun November 22nd, 2009 06:09:16 PM

So, it's mid November. Which in Arizona makes it spring.

In any case, the weather's nice. Anyone know of some good ideas for Urban
Exploration 'round these parts? I tried looking around some on the interwebs,
but everything was either:

  a) A known tourist location (lame)
  b) Covered in scorpions
  c) Really far out of town. (Hardly URBAN at all)

The old Mill in Tempe looks like it'd be awesome, but I'm pretty sure homeless
people live there. Too bad we don't have a cool subway system like other big
cities... The Mrs and I have been wanting to explore somewhere for a while, but
it's usually prohibitively hot outside. And we're total noobs at this.

My Domain used to be the Camelback Colonnade / Builtmore area you would be
surprised where you can get in those buildings, I think my best find ever was a
sub basement at the CISCO SYSTEMS building, they had boxes upon boxes of files
in areas that had been fenced off it was pretty awesome. Another building was
being renovated and I just sorta walked in and explored around, that was kinda
cool.

Anyway I'm just saying any modern multilevel building is gonna have its
interesting UE areas, just pick one and walk around every floor like yours lost,
eventually you will find something awesome.

The brand new high rise in downtown Tempe was foreclosed and now is totally
vacant! It's the one right next to the Harkin's parking garage on about Maple
and 6th street.

I went by there for after class just today, and it's definitely empty. I also
spotted a fire escape going all the way up the thing along the side. There's
only a rickety make-shift fence in front of it.

AltF4.

I was looking for a PoI to that highrise last night and saw a security guard on
site. He looks like he's got a post set up 24/7.
