## Ghost Malls
Posted by **dual** on Mon June 16th, 2008 12:24:42 PM

Ghost malls, and malls in general, are great places for UE. My fave was Winrock
mall in Albuquerque. It had multiple levels/entrances/exits, long hallways, dark
antechambers, etc. The mall at Scottsdale and Camelback seemed good, though
kondor said it was so-so. Are there any good malls in the Valley? Fiesta?

One of the bonuses of exploring malls is wide-open telephone equipment. Often
it's locked up behind chain link fence, but if it isn't, well, you always have
your beige and dialer with you, right?

Here's a ghost mall in China from Boing Boing that prompted this post:

There was some construction at paradise valley mall, my friend who works at KB
toys was telling me about how cool it looked half torn down... too bad we didn't
get any pics of the rubble.

I've seen the 'secret' tunnel doors open at the mall as well, I was tempted to
walk around inside.

Good time to practice your social engineering skills. Just walk in playing the
lost new mall employee.
