Word Problems.  Ha ha...yes... looks like you took my advice to have the computer give the wrong answer.  <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

Nice tunes.  You'd probably be killer on a synth keyboard thingy.  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) --> I think you may have surpassed your instrument.  Heh.

The first 9 tracks are done on 100% grey gameboy running LSDJ, a tracker program by some cool guy.
10 was made using a speak and math toy, reason and ableton live
11 was LSDJ + reason
12 same
13 my LSDJ cartridge memory got corrupted and that's what happened when I tried to play a song
