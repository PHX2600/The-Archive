## Linksys WRT54GL Wireless G Router - $50
Posted by **PHLAK** on Tue May 12th, 2009 12:41:41 AM

I've had a WRT54GL lying around my house for a while I would like to see put to
good use.  This is the "L" model meaning Linux, or basically, it's built
specifically to make it easy to install custom firmware on it.  Here's a link to
the NewEgg page:
<http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833124190>

This bad boy is new, in the packaging.  It has been opened and I powered it on
once, when I got it, to make sure it worked.

If you so choose, for no extra charge, I will install either of the following
custom firmwares on the device before selling it to you.

  * Tomato - <http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato>
  * DD-WRT - <http://www.dd-wrt.com>

(Either firmware is leaps-and-bounds better than the default firmware and
comparable to the other, but my personal preference is Tomato.)

_If you don't plan on installing custom firmware on this router at some point,
please don't buy it._

Retail Price: $70 + Shipping

**Your Price: $50**

I will bring it to the next meeting if someone wants it.

**EDIT:** I have updated firmware to Tomato, but have not done anything else
with this router.

The price varies if there are deals going on (as with all products), but typical
price I've seen is $70.
