Posted by **alienkid** on Mon May 26th, 2008 02:32:13 AM

kinda off topic, but i see all these red box vending machine things everywhere and about 5 minutes ago I think.... red box! like old school radio slut tone dialer red box.  why did it take me so long?  any time isee the # 2600 I immediately think of &quot;its got a 28.8bps modem!&quot;

so anyway, about 3 months ago at a meet someone was showing me some present day red boxing.  I'm the one who DL'd the quarter tones to my cell.  i was hoping for another demonstration sometime

One dolla DVD rentals!  Is there a possibility of someone redboxing a redbox vending machine?  <!-- s:shock: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><!-- s:shock: --> 

Random anecdote:
In high school algebra class I was digging around in my backpack for something and pressed the play button on my tape recorder that had quarter tones on it... my teacher thought it was a ring tone or something and told me to TURN IT OFF  <!-- s:oops: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" /><!-- s:oops: -->  I don't even have a cellphone teach, just trying experiments with the pay phones.

I guess the closest I got to redboxing the red box was to look up the codes to rent for free.
 If only I could play the quarter tones 4 times to get credit on those things lol

That was me, alienkid. I missed you if you were there last night. You can presumably still get an ACTS prompt as described in Royal's Winter 06-07 2600 article, Red Boxing Revealed for the New Age. In Qwest territory it involves 411 and two ops, which I haven't done. The last time I red boxed was with an FSH Fortress that dropped a quarter tone on itself when the switch hook was flashed (calls still cost a quarter), and before that was &quot;SE&quot; red boxing.

Btw, here's the old thread and recording of the pay phone that owned itself:
