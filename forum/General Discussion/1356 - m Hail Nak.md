He may be coming back.
A little wack,
Knows a Bit 'bout a thing called a Stack.

He don't mean dolla bills,
He be talkin' 'bout computa thrills.

Singularity and El es Dee,
Fuck you talking 'bout officer?! 'tis all technology.

So strap on your boots, the ass kickin' kind
Cuz Dolemite motha fucka... is getting outta his bind

FPGA, Garnet OS, Treo 755P
Spoonin' chicks and Forkin' Trees

This is one fsck'r who's never /bin/fsck'd
This is river and beast who don't fear bein' deck'd

anyway... that was sort of fun, hopefully it was fun for you too.  I'll start another topic to ask my question fellas, but seriously...  I may be moving back to the metropolis next month or month after.  Broke as a mofo, staying out of school and always chin deep in ball cringing troubles  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->
