Would be interesting to know how they traced this back to the self-checkout
registers ... also, <3 the use of tampered as an adjective. *grinz*

Ouch. The thing I hate about a skimmer is that they are hard to detect. Many
ATM's, self-checkouts, gas pumps, etc.. are built modular, so they already look
suspicious in their default state. The only self defense I can think of is to
grab it and make sure it doesn't come off easily (which is far from foolproof),
and also make sure the one your using doesn't look different than the other ones
in the area (unless there is only one of them, or they are all skimmed).

Any other self-defense ideas out there? My techniques suck. I guess I'm at-least
always looking for them though.

Without sarcasm -- the best defense is probably to just pay for things in cash.

While I totally agree with this, it's just not practical in the world of today.
This did, however, get me thinking about things like Google Wallet and how they
have the ability to change things for the better.  While I don't know the ins
and outs of Wallet I believe, using the NFC capabilities of our phones and the
security and verification provided by Google, there's a huge potential to be a
highly secure form of digital payments.  The only problem here lies in your
trust of the provider of said technology.
