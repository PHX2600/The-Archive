Posted by **Rax** on Thu February 4th, 2010 10:34:27 PM

So, is anyone interested in the following shirt:  ([url=http&#58;//droidshirts&#46;com/shirts/images/touch&#46;png:1es2ipv2]pic[/url:1es2ipv2]). I ordered a medium and received a large. I've since been shipped out a medium, and the company told me to keep the large.

So the shirt is [url=http&#58;//droidshirts&#46;com/shirts/index&#46;php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=12_16&amp;products_id=67:1es2ipv2]$20[/url:1es2ipv2] (plus $9.95 shipping).  This large shirt can be yours for the low, low price of $10.

I'll bring it to the meeting on 2/5/10 if anyone is interested.
