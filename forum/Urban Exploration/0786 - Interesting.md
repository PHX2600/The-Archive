I guess I really use to do this, when I use to ride street in phoenix on my 20"
i made it to all sorts of spots. And I drove around this city for years, there
is so much shit out in the valley to explore. I used to hit the back of grocery
stores and hardware stores and banks and shit like that. Biltmore was always the
funnest, looking for big gaps and wall rides. Never even realized it, every
chance I got I would go inside some where, construction sites, abandoned
buildings, schools on the weekends. I remeber back home in carson/reno/lake
tahoe area there are casinos everywhere. I used to just open doors and start
waling through, found a way into the hot tubs at one casino up the street from
high school, sure that didn't help my grades. And social engineering, I can tell
you to talk your way into the back of any grocery store without causing any
alarm.

Well, here is a random pic I snapped one day out doing some work, shoulda gone
in, didn't, I fail, at least I got the pic though. kinda represents the
economy...
