Who's going?
What's happening?
Why aren't you going if you're not going?
What are you bringing?
Who's presenting what?

I should have my slides for my talk at Toorcamp ***mostly*** ready by then.  Anyone up for a sneak-peek special screening of my presentation on search engine obfuscation with the Haystack Project?  <!-- s8-) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /><!-- s8-) -->

I'm *sooo* there.  I've go no other plans, it's the summer - friggin' awesome.  I'm bringing the graveyard previously known as my PS-2.  I have disected it to the core because it was fragged anyway and not reading *any* discs.  

I'm going to be bringing a smallish tv and if anyone has a spare power strip laying around... ^o^

I will be checking boards prior to leaving- ante up.

P.s. Going to bring the camera - I'll let another *responsible* adult use it if they wish (since I'll be busy tinkering).

I will be presenting on my laptop my 8 step process of taking control of a live computer system. I start by going over static disassembly, then go over packet sniffing, then FTP access, then backdoor building, then source code analysis on the said site, then if I figure it out, port knocking, and finally priv escalation. 

It's not really a guide or a tutorial, its just watching me go from nothing to something,s o if you want to see how attackers get in, show up to the meet.

I'm not promising anything, but I'll try to be there.  If I do show up it will probably be closer to 6:30-7pm.
