## Little Brother Play

Hey guys, check this out:

Little Brother (The Cory Doctorow novel) is going to be in Phoenix the next few days (Thurs - Sat) in play form.

I think it would be awesome to see... but the link says it's a High School production. And... yea... high school. My (admittedly brief) attempts to google for more info turned up nothing. 

Does anyone know anything more about this? (Like who's putting it on, exactly) Or is anyone interested in going? My wife and I might this Friday.

Later,
Alt

yea... high school.

I'll probably pass and just read the book again.
