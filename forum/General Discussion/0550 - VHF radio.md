## VHF radio

Forums have been pretty slow lately, whats everyone doing? 

I just got into amateur aka ham radio, got my license at Defcon for 14 bucks which isn't bad for ten years, the expensive part is the radio. I got myself a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Meters:2n38l175]2 meter> [url=http://www.icomamerica.com/en/products/amateur/mobile/2200h/default.aspx:2n38l175]icom-2200h>. 

The fun part is the port where the remote/mic plugs in is standard RJ45 and they supply you with its pinout, so I have crafted my own cable which runs between a microcontroller and the radio allowing me to issue commands and data to the radio via a python program. 

Attempts at digital modes have been as of yet unsuccessful but it shouldn't be long before the bugs get worked out of that. (like the repeater operator interrupting the broadcast to say he thinks my radio is broken because all he hears is noise  <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: --> ). 

The typical speed for fm or [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying:2n38l175]FSK> modulated data is 1200bps which is pretty dang slow but I have found a few protocols that do 9600bps. I keep reading that the minimum required frequency for 9600bps is 4800Hz but many standard radios have a much higher bandwidth easily in the kHz range, So if/when I get 9600 baud working I would like to push the envelope and see if we cant get something a little higher speed going.

hopefully me and NaK will have some cool stuff going before the October meet and we can do a demo.

for more technical detail <http://www.amsat.org/amsat/articles/g3ruh/109.html> is a good source also Wikipedia ftw.

Dang military mobile units? newer ones or old style? either way probably worth a ton. would be cool to see pics, even cooler if you got your license.
