## Diaspora
Posted by **AltF4** on Tue August 2nd, 2011 10:39:45 PM

Hey, I just made a Diaspora account, and it's pretty awesome so far. (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://joindiaspora.com/">https://joindiaspora.com/</a><!-- m -->) It's a distributed and Free Software social network. It's in private alpha stage, so you need an invite to get an account. I should have 10 to give out, should anyone want to join. You totally should

EDIT: Probably want to sign up soon. Before all the good usernames are taken. XD

Diaspora... isn't that the con game that a bunch of students came up with to bilk tens of thousands of dollars out of suckers on Kickstarter?  <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: --> 

I chipped in $5.  I played with it when it came out, but it was way, way &quot;un-ripe.&quot;

It seems almost moot now, especially in light of G+

I don't know about moot. Google+ is still everything that's wrong with Facebook, really. Proprietary code, complete lack of privacy, etc... Diaspora is an actual solution to that. 

As for features, it seems pretty well along to me today. It has all the major things social networking sites have, friends, status messages, picture uploading, whatever.

Identi.ca vs Twitter
Diaspora vs G+, Facebook

woot <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->
How do we herd the masses known as our friends to these places, back when I joined AOL instant messenger it wasn't because it was my first choice of IM client, it was because the people I interacted with face to face used it.

PS.
Invite me <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) --> I'll check it out, but it's like... seriously it's gotta be getting close to folding in on itself, or realizing it's swallowing it's own tail or whatever. Oops crazy talk. Will stop <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

I'd say the future of social networks will be free and non-proprietary... but people seem to like being on a leash, I've noticed.   

So what's a good username?  And how do you get real friends?  I don't want to wade through a bunch of guys flopping their dicks in my face.  I know you have to wade through a lot of dicks to find some real friends, but I want INSTANT QUALITY FRIENDS NOW.

While I'd love a free and open social networking site/client, it will never happen.  The main target of social networking is the... under-informed.  That being said, I think Facebook has been dead for a long time, and have high hopes for Google+.  It's still not perfect, but I Google has earned my trust over the years and is doing it's best to make it clear that what you post on G+ is open/public, while at the same time, belongs to you, the content creator.

I agree with Rax though, the &quot;kids&quot; making Diaspora really didn't know what they were doing to begin.  Diaspora has gotten a lot better though since early on, but I still think their biggest downfall will be their decision to use Ruby on Rails. Unlike Facebook who uses PHP mostly, Ruby/Rails isn't supported by many typical shared hosting providers, and few people who run a VPS or dedicated box will want to host their own Diaspora clone anyway.  And in Google's case, running mostly Python, they have the dedicated infrastructure already and teams to maintain it.

I wouldn't trust Google at all, but I'll have to get into that more later... ;P

Speaking of Google, I find it extremely annoying that I can't be logged into youtube and gmail at the same time with different email addresses.  When Google buys the planet, I suppose I won't be able to breathe and eat at the same time.

This is because of the way Google uses a single sign on for all their web services and it makes perfect sense.  The majority of their users only have ONE Google account and use it for all their Google services.  Even I (who has a dozen different Google accounts), use ONE primarily and enjoy the fact that I don't have to sign in multiple times to access all their different services.

Is there a specific reason you're using two different accounts? If you think it's more secure or gives you better privacy control I advise you to re-think your strategy.

With cookies, why would you have to sign in multiple times?  I don't understand what  you mean.  There was nothing wrong with the old method.

Yeah, some email addresses I use for random signups, some for online ordering, some for banking, and some for personal use.  I don't want my youtube emails to be mixed in with any of those other things.  If any one of my email addresses is comprised in someway, it will not affect everything else I do online.  I already learned a lesson once as far as that goes.

So, if you're someone that likes to lump everything together like the NWO and information awareness office does, it's not a problem.  But if you like to be a little more organized, and want to have public and private email addresses, as well as sensitive not-so sensitive material separated in your emails, you'll not like it very much.

You may want to consider using Google's [url=http&#58;//googleblog&#46;blogspot&#46;com/2011/02/advanced-sign-in-security-for-your&#46;html:1b8ikzum]two factor authentication[/url:1b8ikzum] then.  This is probably the best thing you can do for securing your Google account security.

Only problem with that is that I can't be secure from Google itself. 

Keep in mind, &quot;Skynet is the the virus!&quot;

Wow, I came across a work around for logging into gmail and youtube separately that someone had worked out, but they've recently &quot;fixed&quot; it.

The problem is that you're trying to use the system in a way it is explicitly NOT designed.  And ,while I know we're all &quot;hackers&quot; and love to go against the grain, when you're using a web service like Google, they set the rules.

You can log into youtube and gmail at the same time w/ different accounts.

just use different browsers for each. Works for us.
youtube:firefox
gmail:chrome

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Valveritas** on Fri December 9th, 2011 03:15:35 PM

Yeah. 

So, just need something to simulate this instead of actually opening another browser.  Opening another browser wastes memory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Medicine Storm** on Fri December 9th, 2011 05:01:29 PM

And wasted memory is something you can never, ever get back... as opposed to the wasted time of logging OUT of gmail so you can log IN to youtube under a new account. THAT is a renewable resource!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Valveritas** on Fri December 9th, 2011 06:33:53 PM

Logging in and logging out is for slaves of the empire.

Posted by **ArchAngel** on Tue December 13th, 2011 11:46:21 AM

Incognito / In-Private mode should allow you to log into the same service with different accounts, non? Ctrl+Shift+P in IE, Ctrl+Shift+N in Chrome -- I forget the shortcut in FireFox, but sure it's similar. This doesn't solve the 'problem' of memory, but I'm assuming that's a joke; you really don't want to share the same cache between your separate sessions, I shouldn't think. ^_-

Not sure if it's related, but are you by chance just wanting to run multiple GTalk sessions? If so, you may want to try running the exectuable with the '/nomutex' switch; that should let you run as more than one account at the same time ... useful if you have a private and a public account you'd like to monitor simultaneously, or you want to keep an eye on your GTalk bot, etcetera. *grinz*

Posted by **Valveritas** on Fri December 16th, 2011 08:38:39 AM

All I'm trying to do is log into youtube and be logged into another gmail simultaneously in the same browser.   This is a user level [i:36ka0ghb]necessity[/i:36ka0ghb], and it still boggles my mind WHY they expect you to use one gmail account for EVERYTHING.  Never mind bots.  Never mind that I could whistle into a phone and cause nuclear war.  This is really about SUB-PAR design interfacing with the user.
