Wow jargon, a normal post. Keep these coming and we may lighten the restrictions (gradually).

What kind of car is that, cant really tell from the over head view? Would you let me use it to demonstrate wafer lock picking?

The car was a prototype for the Nissan 'Z'. it was one of the few &quot;Saturn&quot;s made by Nissan after the point it was re-branded for General Motors. Major difference between it and a Normal 1991 Saturn Twin-Cam SC1 was that the engine had custom Nissan 'Z' parts and accelerated at up to 1.6g's to an estimated top speed of 170mph before total engine failure due to a lack of engine cut-off. Also this particular car had one-way glass. (Yes, I actually on one occasion actually accelerated it the full-out 1.6g's on a desolate area of the Loop 202 to roughly 135mph.)

The car was &quot;totaled&quot; in 2006 or so when some out of stater ass-hat in a rental sport utility vehicle turned left in front of me and simply stopped in the middle of the intersection at 94th Street and Cactus Road in Scottsdale, AZ; sticking into my oncoming lane as I entered the intersection headed West only 3 miles from my parent's house. I only got $1800 for the car from his insurance company even though the car was a first and only one of its kind and was worth at-least 10G due to sheer rarity and performance power. When I originally obtained the car in 2003, it had roughly 3000 miles on it. Also, it had a Nissan dash display instead of a GM dash display.

The time I hauled ass the full-out 1.6g's all the way up to 135mph, I had to less than a week later take it to some whatever the fuck you have we can fix it, even if it has NOs auto called called ADVANTAGE AUTO (i think) on 16th Street and Rosher Lane in West Phoenix, which at the time was owned and operated by a ridiculously genius German immigrant father and his two even more ridiculously genius German immigrant sons, due to the A/C Clutch on the thousand mile long serpentine belt in the engine having been tore from its mounted axis and simply causing the belt to wear down and billow smoke. For some reason Nissan put in an A/C Clutch that didn't even need to be on the serpentine belt. That was the only defect in the entire craftsmanship of my Nissan 'Z' prototype.

The car has since been sold to a chop-shop because I didn't have the funds to file a lawsuit against the opposing insurance company in order to get the money to completely repair the car. The only damage to the car was the front left flip light needed to be cut out and have a replacement welded in along with the driver corner panel swapped out, radiator swapped out, and frontal collision cross beam cut out and replaced. Only reason there was so much damn damage was the flip light was open and it ended up stabbing into the chassis of the car like a hot knife through butter. if the flip lights had been down there may very well have been a quarter inch of stopping distance between my car and the SUV due to my car being so damn low profile compared to the SUV. Had I had the headlamps turned on I could very well just have ended up with the very front edge of the &quot;Nissan Saturn Z&quot; barely hanging under the edge of the other dude's SUV.

It was either full out slam the breaks, or risk either careening into and flipping in a ditch, nailing a stop light, or worse yet imploding the entire driver's side cabin. Yes the light turned red for me after the collision had already occurred and both cars were at already at rest. I was only going 3 miles per hour faster than the speed limit of 35mph when thre light turned yellow for me when i attempted to stop and didn't have the stopping power to keep from breaching the intersection, and let go of the break when the dumb-fuck decided it was a good time to turn left even though i didn't have enough stopping distance for my speed in comparison to the timing of the light turning yellow.

However, ThatGuy, you will be delighted to hear an actual 1993 GM Saturn Sedan i had prior, one day i parked in a spot in front of the GNC(?) Vitamin and Supplement Store at Frank Lloyd Wright Boulevard and Raintree Drive in Scottsdale in order to pick up something at the Safeway; when i returned to my car and got in and sat down ready to start the ignition I noticed something very strange, suddenly my driver seat had a wooden bead mat on it and the interior of the car was a lighter shade. I damn well sat there confused for 5 seconds, got the hell out of the car and noticed it had the forest green paint job, not the spectra-paint stuff that is glossy green during the day and shimmery blue at night and realized my car was parked two spaces over. My key worked in some other person's 1993 GM Saturn Sedan. I didn't have the balls to pull a prank and start the engine and back out then park the car facing the opposite direction though. I left the door unlocked because I damn well didn't want to risk that the key only unlocks the door but doesn't lock it, end up breaking their lock and having my fingerprints all over it. I then got in my car and floored the hell out of there due to being so damn spooked about it.

Regarding that last sentence, I have actually heard of that happening with other people too. On of my old friends Lindsey had her truck key work on other vehicles of the same make. Kind of bad.

I believe it completely wafer locks have very sloppy tolerances. When the keys and the wafers start to wear down the minor variation from key to key would allow your key to operate another key. It sort of works of the same principle as the Marshal keys I showed a while back. The Saturn's made in the 90's had huge security flaws not only in the locks but in the window design as well. It was one of the highest stolen cars for several years in a row. It always made the top 3 list for those reasons. I have tried marshal keys on few Saturn's and they are by far the easiest GM car to open with them. Another thing is that the window doesn't go into the top of the door frame it just sort of rests on the outside. People could easily pull it back and fish the door lock open.  
 
Different keys working on other cars or even residential locks is common. Sometimes all you have to do is pull out the key 1 or 2 spaces and it will work. Even a little rocking motion with turning pressure is enough to open the lock. When I was in the dorms years ago every other door key would operate your neighbors door if you pulled it out 1/2 a space. This is just a bad setup and not enough variation in the depths between change keys. Try it out it will surprise you how often it works, you never know it might get you out of a bind.

Funny you mention that,

This 1991 Nissan &quot;Saturn&quot; Z that I mentioned, the windows actually had a modded translucent black frame of some sort that covered the top edge of the side windows. The only problem with that was they did not do the same for the &quot;moon-roof&quot;. Also, the door/ignition key for it wasn't standard. It was a third longer than a normal Saturn key.
