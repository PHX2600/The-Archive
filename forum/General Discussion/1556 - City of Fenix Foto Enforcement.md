Edit: Linksys WAP is just a neighborhood service apparently.
Edit 2: Yeah, sorry, poor choice of words on my part. The signal was really strong at the vehicle. There wasn't a WAP on the roof.

laaaaaawl!

Seriously an unencrypted WiFi link on those things? (And default password on the router?!) I wonder what they use the wifi for? Probably for getting info about speeders. I would not be surprised at all to learn that there's a NAS hooked up to the WiFI that has a listing of all the photos that the van takes.

Oh, shit. If I'm right about there being a hard drive behind that WiFi AP, then not only could you download the pictures of speeders, you could upload them. With a little GIMPing, you could give someone a speeding ticket they don't deserve. If that's true, this is actually quite a story.

... and even better, just wipe say 50% every day. Speeding ticket fairy.

wow, that's almost as bad as the black van that parked up the street a couple years ago, they got there about 3AM, put up one of those paper sun screens in the front window, and nobody got out of the van, simultaneously a new network SSID showed up.... "SurveillanceVan023". It showed up each night for 3 days, then one morning they raided a house up the street. It was a fencing operation.

I never did get up the courage to go knock on the door and offer them coffee and donuts, though I surely was tempted.
