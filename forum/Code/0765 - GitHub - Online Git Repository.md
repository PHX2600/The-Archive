## GitHub - Online Git Repository
Posted by **PHLAK** on Fri March 6th, 2009 12:30:34 AM

For anyone who codes, and especially if your code is open source, I recomend checking out <http&#58;//github&#46;com>, an online Git repository. Git is a simple/fast version control system, and GitHub is a website dedicated to hosting and sharing your code repositories.

From git's website: 
[quote:1pz6ohx0]Git is an open source, distributed version control system  designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Every Git clone is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server. Branching and merging are fast and easy to do.[/quote:1pz6ohx0]

Git works on all three major OS's (Linux, MAC, and even Windows) and is very easy to set up and get going.

I [b:1pz6ohx0]HIGHLY[/b:1pz6ohx0] recommend checking GitHub out, and if you do, be sure to follow myself (<http&#58;//github&#46;com/PHLAK[/url:1pz6ohx0]), dual ([url:1pz6ohx0]http&#58;//github&#46;com/dual[/url:1pz6ohx0]), and minddog ([url:1pz6ohx0]http&#58;//github&#46;com/minddog>)

I had trouble getting started with this, something about not having filled out the encryption key part of the form. Most of the time I'm on Win32, any advice?

I had problems with this too at first (I am also running Git on Windows), once I figured it out I was amazed at how easy it was to set up and get going with Git and GitHub.

Take a look at this screencast: <http&#58;//gitcasts&#46;com/posts/git-on-windows>, follow along and you'll be up on GitHub in no time!  I watched the entire video but didn't pay too much attention to the GUI part, I'm strictly using Git Bash (command line).

Good luck with getting this going, and if you have any further questions, let me know.
