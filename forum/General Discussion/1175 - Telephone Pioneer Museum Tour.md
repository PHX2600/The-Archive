## Telephone Pioneer Museum Tour
Posted by **dual** on Thu December 17th, 2009 08:45:32 AM

Anyone up for a tour of the Telephone Pioneer Museum? It's located at the 36th St. and Indian School switch and we have to make arrangements in advance, which I will gladly do. We did the same thing in Albuquerque with ABQ2600 and the telephone museum there. It was an amazing time and well worth it. And hopefully we can get a little tour of the CO as well.  Post your preferred day and I'll pick a date after the holidays.

I'M DOWN!  Any Saturday after 2pm or Sunday all day works for me.  Try to plan this a week or two out though to make sure people can free up their schedules if necessary.

No response from the museum, so no tour 9 JAN. I'll keep trying...
