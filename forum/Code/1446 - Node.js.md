## Node.js

Anyone looking at this? Hearing about this? Playing with it? Developing with node.js?

It's server side javascript running off the v8 js engine.
It has it's own package manager npm which allows you to download 'modules/libraries' for node, including the impressive socket.IO

I've been fiddling with it a bit lately, haven't done much really, but I have a few ideas and am learning about couchDB as well (an erlang database project that has been absorbed into the Apache project) -- really slick.
