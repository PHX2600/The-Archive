## Free calls at Coyotes game
Posted by **dual** on Sat January 26th, 2008 10:17:14 PM

Had tickets for the &quot;Qwest Luxury Suite Level&quot; at Jobing arena and Qwest were kind enough to provide free local calls. Reorder on toll calls. CPN is 623-772-3200, the main number. Pics...

Cool! Lucky dude.
I was at the marquee and was messing with their &quot;Free Phone&quot; that is to be used to call cabs if you are trashed, I found that dialing */#3(areacode+number) (I cant remember whether it was pound or star) would let you make free phone calls outside of taxi services. *edit: CPN for the free phone @ marquee theater: 602-443-0153

I also ran into the same &quot;free phone&quot; at some large go cart place where I did some merchant training through radioshack.

I guess I'll just have to get some VIP tickets and do some MF*'n manual scanning!

Also, we should move the phreak ref. over to the new forums, I forgot what CPN stood for (calling party number), and I'm not afraid to admit it!  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

Woh, that's a good find! They have those all over, cause they're free. I wonder if that trick works on all of them or if it's a customizable option in the payphone.

Thanks! If you can test it out, that would be cool, I really don't get to run into them often.
