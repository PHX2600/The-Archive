## local source of FPC cables?
Posted by **urbex** on Fri January 20th, 2012 02:14:25 PM

Called around to half a dozen places this morning with no luck (I think I hit Capital, Arrow, Circuit Specialists, Computer Cable Specialists, and a couple others I can't remember now).  I'm in need of a couple 40 conductor, .5mm pitch, FPC cables (the paper thin flat ribbon cable, not stuff like IDE ribbon cables).  

I know Digikey has them, but I was hoping to avoid having to make an order for a couple $3 cables if I could avoid it.  I'm not holding my breath on finding some place local to the valley that has them, but figured I'd at least ask here before I call Digikey on Monday.

Dont know of anyone locally that carries them, I saw a roll a couple of years ago at Apache Reclamation, don't know how many conductors it had, and don't know what the odds are that they still have some. Can try giving them a call 602-254-0613

Definitely look into Apache Reclamation, they have all kinds of cool old stuff.

Looks like it would be expired though <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( -->

Sorry, didn't notice the date on it <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( --> 

Oh well, going to have to head down there this weekend anyway. Need to find some odds and ends, maybe try to get a nice rackmount signal generator while I'm there too, one of these days I'm going to get their helium laser if it's still there when I have a bunch of money and nothing better to spend it on.

Ok, so I'm horrible at keeping up on these forum posts, lol.  I had completely forgotten about the reclamation place..I too need to make a visit down there just for the heck of it.  

For reference though, what I'm looking for isn't the round stranded stuff where you can peel off however many conductors you need, like what is typically found in IDE cables, but rather the flat foil bonded to the poly substrate stuff that goes into ZIF connectors.  I'm sure it will just need to be a digi-key order item, but I figured it couldn't hurt to ask.

Came upon a guy tonight who has rolls of plastic sheets with 100 angstroms of copper on each side if you are feeling creative and havent found your cables yet theres some possibility there.
