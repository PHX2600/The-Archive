Posted by **TerrorDrone** on Sat February 6th, 2010 07:34:36 PM

need to do some work involving a dremel and some drill bits at home and left my drill bit adapter rings at work so the 3/32 bit wouldn't fit tight enough into the dremel head not wanting to go buy new adapters tonight i just took some heat shrink tubing and fit it around the shank of the drill bit.It worked perfectly and the heat shrink was removed with almost no effort after i was done. So just a simple little trick if you are every in same spot.

You forgot to preface this post with &quot;PROTIP&quot;, but I forgive you.
