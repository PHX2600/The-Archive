I'm pretty sure most of you have heared about it by now, any thoughts or opinions?

Also, some rumors flying around that you may be able to score one for $99 if you have an &quot;old&quot; Google account.  Source: [url:1t1che01]http&#58;//www&#46;androidguys&#46;com/2009/12/14/reuters-nexus-one-available-directly-through-google-website-january-5/[/url:1t1che01]

Hope this is true, my Google account is ~5 (maybe more) years old.

We like ours. It is a hacked google android phone, though it is not the newest &quot;droid&quot; phone. Are you just talking about the new droid or any google phone?

This is a phone STRAIGHT from Google.  No carriers in between.  Lots of news out there on it, look up &quot;Google Nexus&quot; on any search engine and there's all sorts of news on it.

If it does what it claims to do I think this may change the mobile business and open up lots of exciting avenues.
