## Free Hardware if your social engineering is up to it...
Posted by **LosT** on Tue February 5th, 2008 12:52:35 AM

Every so often TI does what they call 430 days, that is a product release where they do live trainings all over the world-  What does this mean to you?  3 hours of training on a new super low power uController from TI, and you get a FREE kit (read: programmer, chips, and software)-

How do you accomplish this?  Go sign up and get 'accepted'-  Enter social engineering-

There are two Phoenix locations listed- they are at the same locations, one is just earlier in the morning.  One session has 14 seats left.  The other has 45.

When you fill in your info, estimate that you are creating a product, and that you are in the initial stages.  If at any time they ask for details, tell them it violated NDA.  Technically this isn't illegal, just exaggerated.  

Maybe I'll see some of you there!

Entering contests is always a good way to get free stuff also- usually when circuit cellar has a contest they send you free hardware to participate in the contest (or at the very least discounts on the dev kits)-

But the TI type trainings are always great because they give you training AND the free hardware...

If anyone needs a ride to the TI thing let me know.  I'm going to the one in the morning...
