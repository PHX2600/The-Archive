If anyone needs a particular cable, post here, I know we all have a shi*ton of
this kind of stuff... well I do.

looking for 70+ ft. of RG-8 cable, prefer an RG-8/U but will settle for mini 8
so long as the conductor is a minimum 16 a.w.g.

Cash if the price is right, or trade for something you are looking for.

Hi Junker, that's a pretty intense request, but I can't blame you for trying,
the only place I would know to check is ham radio outlet, but they'll probably
be pretty expensive.

I am actually looking for a 3 cable RCA (red, white, yellow) and I'm not in any
rush, so if anyone has one they can bring to the next meeting I'd be grateful
and would be willing to trade lulz button or a dollar or 2 for it :)

I may have one of those.  Remind me closer to the next meeting to grab it for
you.

Definitely have lots of RCA cables if you are in the east valley, I'm out in
east mesa/AJ area, but do get into town frequently, probably won't be to a
meeting any time soon, but if you need it, leave me a message here, will give
you a phone number.

I am in the process of cataloging all my excess junk for trade/sale. If you are
interested you can get a sneak preview here on flickr, definitely lots of cables
available. If you see something you might be interested send me a msg

Got 100ft. of RG8/U, Belden with a 10 a.w.g. conductor and double shield
tonight, used but in good condition, did a quick resistance check on it tonight,
seems to be in great shape, no shorts or breaks. Can't beat the price either,
found a guy on CB tonight who said, come get it and it's yours. 54 mile round
trip, but hey, I'll take that for free. After a long debate with myself I have
decided not to tick off the neighbors and mount the antenna at 1AM, it will have
to wait until tomorrow. If anyone needs shorter lengths, I will probably have
some left over, can solder on a PL-259 or BNC connector if needed too. This
stuff is hard to find locally, and $1.50 - $2/ft online.
