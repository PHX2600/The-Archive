I know Defcon/Vegas is closer, but this _is_ a 2600 group, ain't it? (At least
according to the distressed red text at the top of the page it is).

:)

I've got a room reserved, but still not 100% sure if I'm going at this point.

Who else is considering making the cross-country trek?

Well, looks like I'll be officially going, via multiple planes (William Shatner
failed to find me a cheap nonstop flight).  I should probably book my room
finally...
