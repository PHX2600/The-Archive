[quote=&quot;Ugly&quot;:22r0i3gq]Hmmm. I'd give them a call, as that conflicts with their posted holiday hours:

*Edit*
I called and they confirmed they'll be open on new years eve and new years day. If anyone else wants to call and see if they get a different answer, feel free. 480-839-4263[/quote:22r0i3gq]

I called to verify and confirmed that they [b:3aluonca]won't be open to the public[/b:3aluonca] during the specific hours in question.

Gameworks is closing at [b:3aluonca]8pm[/b:3aluonca] on Dec 31st for a [b:3aluonca]private[/b:3aluonca] party, but will reopen to the public Jan 1st 2010 @ 10am.

PHX2600 can't have their NYE party there.

EDIT:
You can't just call and ask places if they will be open, you have to inquire as to whether they will actually be open to the [b:3aluonca]public[/b:3aluonca] during the [b:3aluonca]specific hours[/b:3aluonca] in question. <!-- s:roll: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><!-- s:roll: -->

I will have to call again tomorrow [b:3aluonca]before 10pm[/b:3aluonca] and inquire as to whether they will be open to the [b:3aluonca]public[/b:3aluonca] during their [b:3aluonca]January 1st 2010 hours of 10am to midnight[/b:3aluonca] in-order to confirm whether we will be able to have our [b:3aluonca]normal meet-up[/b:3aluonca] at 6pm at Gameworks @ Arizona Mills Mall.

According to phone call I made 20 minutes ago inquiring as to &quot;[b:26ss0h6h]public[/b:26ss0h6h] open hours&quot; for &quot;New Years Day&quot; / &quot;January 1st&quot; in 2010.

[b:26ss0h6h]Gameworks @ Arizona Mills Mall:
Jan 1st 2010: 11am to 1am next day, &quot;OPEN TO THE PUBLIC&quot;[/b:26ss0h6h]

We can easily do the meet-up at Gameworks for our First Friday, January 1st 2010 meet-up.
I assume if we have it there, that it will be our usual meet-up time of 6pm?

Most importantly, notice the [b:26ss0h6h]dress code[/b:26ss0h6h] and [b:26ss0h6h]after 10pm[/b:26ss0h6h] rules.

Jargon, that &quot;original&quot; Flobots music video for Handlebars by the film student is here:

Fun fact: I found out about this song because of this World of Warcraft song parody:
