The following are some guidelines that should be followed when posting items for sale or for request.

[list:4adn5tca][*:4adn5tca]Do not attempt to sell anything illegal (ie - drugs, nuclear weapons, prostitution, etc.).[/*:m:4adn5tca]
[*:4adn5tca]If possible, please include an item description and picture of your product and/or a link to the same product on another site (ie - Newegg)[/*:m:4adn5tca]
[*:4adn5tca]Please clearly note the price of an item whether it's $100 or FREE-99[/*:m:4adn5tca]
[*:4adn5tca]When your item is sold/given away, please note that in the thread somewhere and lock the post (I'm pretty sure everyone can lock their own posts, if not let me know)[/*:m:4adn5tca][/list:u:4adn5tca]
[*]When possible, administrators will do their best to avoid scammers, however it's not possible to catch them all. ALL SALES/PURCHASES ARE DONE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Thanks in advanced for following the rules.  F*** you in advanced for breaking them.
