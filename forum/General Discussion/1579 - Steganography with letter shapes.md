## Steganography with letter shapes
Posted by **XlogicX** on Thu March 22nd, 2012 02:13:37 AM

Some Indian researchers explained a method of stego that uses the shape of every first letter of a sentence to define whether it's a 1 or 0. One variation is that if the letter is straight-ish, then it's a 1, if the letter has curves, it's a 0. Interesting.

So the above paragraph would be: 001

I'm not sure why there's a news article about it, as it's not incredibly impressive, but it serves as another example of stego that isn't just images.

Oh, BTW, my talk on "Explosive Steganography" was approved for HOPE 9 a little over a week ago. I have coded interesting tools that I haven't really gone over at the meetings. They are very different from normal stego.
