## Hackers are People Too
Posted by **nytebrew** on Tue June 9th, 2009 08:39:05 AM

I searched the video on demand section of amazon.com for hackers, i wanted to
download that movie from the mid-90's with the crazy screens of teh gibson and
all that. Anyway, the first result is something called "Hacker's are People
Too". So I bought it and started streaming it, and it appears be a compilation
of interviews from Defcon 2007 (15?). I thought I saw Rhy0t in it, which I
wasn't expecting, and then in her second appearance you see her handle rendered
by the character generator. Also, somebody said they got a uController from
LoST. Anyway, check it out, i'm having trouble directly linking to it, but i can
link to the search. Maybe I can bring the video to the next meeting if anyone is
interest, but it's not much money if you want to check it out.

I downloaded the movie off the internet torrent and then I watched it over the
xbox streaming thing and I was like "Man these hackers really think they are the
shit"  So then I watched it all the way through and it was just like an ego
booster and I was all like feeling good and badass n smart n stuff, but then I
stubbed my toe and the toenail died and fell off only half way :(
