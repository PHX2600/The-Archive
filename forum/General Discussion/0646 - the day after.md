funny thing is the gay guy at my wife's job told me obama only won cause of ignorant single mothers never knew that was a politcal force  or even a majority

Yeah, a lot of people have silly opinions like that.

I'm neither happy or sad about the presidential elections, I didn't go to the polls for that choice really.  I voted LBT all across the board save the corporation commissioners and decided to vote yes on 2 of the judges.

We actually have a direct effect on propositions.  I'm glad 200 didn't pass and was sort of surprised that 102 passed, at least they aren't any more 'sinner taxes' that passed this round...

well I gotta go take care of some adware on my uncles computer!!!

I'm about the same as Nak, neither happy nor sad, though I'm sure I'd feel worse had McCain won.

First I heard of that, I agree, happy that didn't pass.

All of my hopes and dreams were with Ron Paul. Thats what the Republicans get for backing the wrong people. McCain and Pailin common did they draw that combo out of a hat, or was it some sort of inside joke.

The elections are a shell game.  You are presented with two big shells, and told to pick from them.  And regardless of how you pick, you lose; you become that much more a slave.

And continually, every so many years, people come back and try to find the ball.  Every election, another politician comes into power to reward their friends and punish their enemies.  And during every election, the problems that result are the fault of someone else, be it the rich, the illegal immigrants, corporations, other countries, other parties, the opposite side of the political spectrum, terrorists, communists, Japanese, Irish, drug addicts and dealers, hackers, racists, prostitutes, gays, religious fundamentalists, atheists, or any other number of scapegoats that happen to be convenient.

Meh.  I was expecting Obama to win by no small margin, but I wasn't exactly cheering for it; I'm more happy McCain lost than Obama won.  I don't own a teevee, so the only was I knew Obama won was by leaving my window open and hearing people honking horns and cheering.  I voted for Barr and most of the rest of the LBT slate.

I stayed the night in Provo, Utah last night though, and holy crap what a depressfest.  I saw a gaggle of ducks almost fight a gaggle of geese in Novell's corporate campus parking lot though, which was kinda cool.  They have a moat, like the kind castles have.  But I digress...

I was into the elections this year. I am super happy about Obama wining and super happy about mccain losing. The reason mccain lost is because he sold out his core values for the GOP core values. I don't even think that this is a vote for the first black president, I think it is a vote against bush and the republican party. All the wingnut conservatives are talking about how they are buying guns cause &quot;Obama gonna takar guuns awaY&quot;. I told me buddy that I was on the other side of the spectrum. If mccain won, I would have bought my first gun and a passport. 

Anyway, I thinkl Obama is gonna be great. Any person that says a black guy in the white house is not change, is full of shit.

No one dares talk about economics, everyone is just looking around for someone to fix this problem and entrusting the institutions that got us into the mess in the first place to get us out.  I see the mess starting with the creation of the federal reserve, others don't look that far back, just really how far you want to look and where.  Depends on what kind of media you have consumed, what schools you've been trained in, and the values that you've been brought up with.  All pieces that make up ones world view.
