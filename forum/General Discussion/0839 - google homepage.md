The homepage of google is practically the only reason I know when some holidays even occur. But today, they have a special logo for Nikola Tesla's birthday, cool.

Yeah they did a good job.

Tesla,

 the forgotten genius who brought the world AC power, and Tesla coils and Cold Fusion and Teleporters.

Mr. Tesla has always been regarded as a hero in my book.  Every time I learn more about him, the more of a bad ass he becomes!
