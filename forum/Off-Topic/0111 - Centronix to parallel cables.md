## Centronix to parallel cables
Posted by **nak** on Wed May 28th, 2008 05:21:27 PM

Anyone need a bunch of these cables? I don't, but it looks like I have about a ton of these guys... I don't know what to do, urban art project maybe, dunno.

I'll keep you updated if I decide to do anything CrEaTiVe @.@

What are they?  I'd look it up, and act like I already know, but maybe this can turn into an actual conversation.   <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

I tend to collect various wires and so on, but haven't really moved into cabling.

They are old printer cables, maybe other uses too (dunno)

^^HOTLINK^^ *tsssssssssssss*

Used on HP printers I know, others as well.

I was going through my wires/cables collection and untangling the huge mess when I found all those! Clean up and move out!

LOL. I have quite a few of those as well. Now I remember what they are called.  I forget they existed.

We should do something useful with them... but what?  Printer robots? <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->  I have a printer that still uses them (inkjet, not a dotmatrix), but the printer is quite lousy. You had to replace the ink constantly.

I was thinking elegant computer bondage photography, I'll post a craigslist ad now  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) --> 

But I was thinking of liquid nails + spray paints on some lone wall, some creative design.

That's kind of twisted.  Some lone wall eh?   I suppose you could form one of the cables into a noose and hang a teddy bear with it, and then replace one of his eyes with a camera and somehow make it into a reference to big brother.   Does that even make sense?  Eh...  <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: -->

The teddy bear represents the learned helplessness and comfort the Institution brings to their citizens, the piece screams how far are people willing to go for "peace of mind"?  How many more basic rights are people willing to give up?  The reason we use the computer cable is to describe how technology has been turned against us and what we once thought was a god send, is now strangling us.

That's not as good as I hoped, my artfag speech synthesizer isn't at full clock speed this morning.

Sweet. That sounds very good.  I think I have a large teddy or two I could donate to this (they were left in the house before me and the gf moved in).   There was also some kind of a possessed talking baby doll, but we threw that out.

Sorry, did I kill the thread?  <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->  Did you do anything with this anyway?

Oh no no, I just haven't done anything, my friend just made a stencil of his dad for fathers day:

I might sketch something out sometime, but I've been "busy" doing nothing lately, pretty crazy how that happens?
