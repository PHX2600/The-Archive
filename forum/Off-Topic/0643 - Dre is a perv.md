(3:15:58 PM) DreDrizz: wait
(3:16:00 PM) DreDrizz: another question
(3:16:08 PM) DreDrizz: will you be watching these movies alone?
(3:16:24 PM) hempknight666420: of course
(3:16:36 PM) DreDrizz: ok don't watch any of the ones that i mentioned then
(3:16:53 PM) DreDrizz: they are all for romance
(3:16:57 PM) DreDrizz: chick flicks
(3:17:18 PM) DreDrizz: they are good for when you find a girl that gives great handjobs and don't mind if the popcorn tastes weird
(3:17:44 PM) DreDrizz: i think you need to get out of the house
(3:17:45 PM) DreDrizz: you have a car
(3:18:05 PM) DreDrizz: try going to the mall and picking up on 16 yro girls
(3:18:13 PM) DreDrizz: invite them to go see scary R rated movies
(3:18:46 PM) DreDrizz: and when they scream too loud in the theatre, make sure to cop a feel before you step out to masturbate in your popcorn
(3:18:57 PM) DreDrizz: then complain to the manager that some girl is screaming too loud in the theatre
(3:19:02 PM) DreDrizz: and then point her out
(3:19:14 PM) DreDrizz: make sure you tell the manager that she's 16 and that you don't know her
(3:19:16 PM) hempknight666420: wow...
(3:20:27 PM) DreDrizz: oh shit i forgot one thing
(3:20:30 PM) DreDrizz: bring cocaine
(3:20:38 PM) DreDrizz: 16 yro girls love fucking on cocaine
(3:20:40 PM) DreDrizz: they will do anything for it
(3:22:51 PM) DreDrizz: try to get them into confined spaces like bathroom stalls and tell them that you'll let them snort a line off your dick if they can make you cum by holding their entire body up without touching the toilet or the floor
(3:23:41 PM) DreDrizz: while giving head (as an example)
(3:23:48 PM) DreDrizz: i can think of better examples
(3:24:00 PM) DreDrizz: it's much better than porn, don't bother with that crap
