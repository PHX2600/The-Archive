That would be pretty slick,

I got my cells on eBay for about 80 cents a watt which is pretty good but not the best i have seen. the tabbing and building materials were another 20-30 bucks.

I gave up on the ham radio skype system last night because I haven't been able to find a way around the hardware limitations i have encountered.

I can still post some code from what i have been working on if anyone wants it, there's a lot of code, all in python basically its a software dtmf decoder that can listen to a live stream and decode tones from the radio and then it uses the skype api to dial out etc.

Been working on CK-Gallery v2.0.0.  Got a ways to go still, but here's some screenshots for your amusement:

Trying to create an electro-mechanical actuator using the voice coil from a ButtKicker bass shaker.

Now if only I could get the damn thing apart...

I'm working on a search engine history obfuscation tool...  I'm also tempted to dip into hardware and use my Zigbee development kit to have my doorbell ring the red alert sound affect on my new Enteprise replica from the new Trek film...
