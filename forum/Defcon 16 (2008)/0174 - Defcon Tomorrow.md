DEFCON 16: August 8-10, 2008
at the Riviera Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas

Anyone going besides me?? Anyone wanna split a room or something?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Avengence** on Wed August 6th, 2008 12:13:06 PM

I wasn't planning on going due to lack of cash, but I just was offered a room
last night. So, now I just need to arrange a ride. I could finish fixing my car
tonight and drive tomorrow, but I really need to minimize expenses including
gas.

So, anyone driving with room for an extra in exchange for some gas money?

There's a thread on the Defcon forums as well with no responses. I talked to the
guy who started it, who said he is not going anymore but I was the fourth to
contact him, so I know there's some others in the area, but not sure if they are
on here.

I'm excited for all of you who are going, this year prior engagements have
prevented me from going to both HOPE and DefCon - very sad.  Have fun to those
who go and let us know how it was!

I think someone on the Phoenix Linux User Group mailing list was planning a car
pool to Vegas for Defcon.  Lemme see if I can find her posting...

k, her name's Lisa, and her e-mail address is: <lisakachold@obnosis.com>.  Let
her know you heard she was organizing a car pool from the Phoenix Linux User
Group and don't tell her you use Windows XP Home edition. :P"

I am down to drive, first road trip with my new car. I could probably bring 2
other people besides myself. Trying to leave room for all the gear.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm in my hotel room at the Riviera (#6120) waiting for you all to get your slow
assess here.

**EDIT: There was construction going on at 7am in the room above mine, so we
moved to room #6120**

Cool. I got a reply from someone in Tucson on the Defcon forums. He is
interested in meeting up with additional people in Phoenix. When are you
planning to head out tomorrow?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Ghostshell** on Thu August 7th, 2008 09:08:34 AM

work till 5 so i was thinking the evening so we would miss traffic. Also i think
we could get there and back on one tank or at most 1 1/2. I filled up to a full
tank last Fri/Sat and i still gots 3/4 left. So dont worry about spending a grip
on gas, since reg is 120. We could leave when i get off, i can pack 2nite and
then when i get off meet ya'll. Were is everybody going to be at? Tempe,
Scottsdale, Mesa? I'll be in Scottsdale.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Avengence** on Thu August 7th, 2008 10:55:01 AM

Chandler. We will be on the way up by then, leaving Phoenix area around noon. I
don't have any schedule constraints, but I know the other person wants to make
it to TBBQ.

Posted by **Ghostshell** on Fri August 8th, 2008 12:37:06 PM

Did you try PHLAK's room yet? Send me some pics!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **taryn** on Fri August 8th, 2008 01:16:05 PM

which room is phlak in? & where is nak? we are in the monaco tower, room #6016

OMG we just got our passes and there was this gigantic line and we were all o
fuk about that because we thought we'd have to wait in it. well we go up to the
registration desk and get the badges right away. the leet blinky ones. i asked
what the other line was for and apparently a bunch of ppl who bought their
passes yesterday got these laminated temp passes until more of the real ones
came in and that huge line was for swapping it out. but we got the "real" ones
right away because we didnt buy them last night. so that was good that we
avoided that line.

the tshirt line was and is still insane. apparently defcon tshirts are a bit of
a status symbol

I'm barely in my room during the day, NAK is in room 3607.  Maybe we can meet up
sometime tonight (Fri) or tomorrow (Sat).  I think we may go out for pizza
tonight (after 7pm sometime), I'll try to check this thread before we do.

that since he missed the wedding, all the non family guests were female.

Hey guys, i had to miss it, i was going to leave on Saturday, but thought i
missed all the goos stuff so i didnt leave. That nite(sat) i ended up getting
robbed at gun point while leaving my appartment. IT WAS F@#@$& INSANE. Then had
to deal with the po po till 2 am. The incident happend about 20:30. I seriously
thought i was going to die at one point. If I had left for the conven like i was
going to the above would have never happend, freewill for ya. That leads me to
the article titled Dont Talk to Cops, after my experience with them on Saturday
night, saying that you need your lawyer or a lawyer before you say anything is
the best thing todo. Even if your just going to give a statement. I ended up
getting screwed a lil even though i was robbed at gun point, had my life
threatend with someone push a gun in the back of my head.... Please send as many
Defcon 16 pics as possible, if anyone would like to see their badge to me after
their done with it and some pics, it would definately improve my week.

Hey everyone!

I just got back from Defcon yesterday, and thought this would be as good of a
place as any other to introduce myself. I'm a Comp Sci grad student over at ASU
studying Info Assurance. I have a real passion for (in)security, lockpicking,
encryption, etc... and I would really like the opportunity to learn and share
from the group.

I didn't think that there was a large (for lack of a better word, I know the
term is over [and mis] used) hacker group around in Arizona until I saw so many
people at the Vegas airport leaving to go to Phoenix with Defcon badges! So
after a small amount of googling, I came across you guys. Nice to meet you!

I'll try to make it over to the next meeting, I know there isn't a thread yet
for it but it should be in September from what I understand.

Thanks a lot!
-AltF4

PS: Damn, Ghostshell. That sounds terrible. Hope you're okay. I don't know if my
spirit could handle being robbed at gunpoint AND missing Defcon in the same
weekend.

Awesome avatar alt-f4 :D

Yeah ghostshell, what the F, that really sucks... I can't imagine how much
stress that is... I've been mugged with fists, but never guns, damn.

Maybe new thread to talk about defcon?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Ghostshell** on Tue August 12th, 2008 08:43:38 AM

agree, thanx for your support guys, the new thread is up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **PHLAK** on Tue August 12th, 2008 07:14:37 PM

I heard about your mugging from Logic Ghostshell, sorry to hear about that, hope
everything ends up okay for you.

@AltF4 - WELCOME!  Glad to have you here!  Unfortunately I don't know when the
next time I'll be able to attend a meeting is, I currently work 1-9pm on
Fridays.  Also, being the site designer, how exactly did you come across this
site?  If it was a Google/Yahoo/other search, what search terms did you use?
I'd like to know so I can better optimize this site for search engine
optimization.  Thnaks.

In terms of Defcon, I don't have many pictures, but I'll be getting up what I do
have in the next couple of days, hopefully.

**Phlak**:

Well, I saw so many Defcon people going back to Phoenix (including two goons on
my flight) that I figured there must be some kind of organization or get-
together for hackers in the area. I first looked up the Defcon-groups, but there
aren't any active ones in Az, apparently. But then I remembered having read on
the DC-Groups guidelines that they claim to "coexist well with 2600 groups" (not
an actual quote from them) so I looked you guys up through the main 2600
website.

So long story short: I've known about 2600 for a long time, but never knew there
were local groups. I heard about the groups from the Defcon website.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Ghostshell** on Thu August 14th, 2008 04:31:13 PM

There is a DC-602 group... I started out belonging to them but then i ran into
LogiX

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **PHLAK** on Sat August 16th, 2008 03:27:00 PM

As far as I know, DC-602 and phx2600 merged a long time ago, and we've been
going like this since then.  If that's not accurate, talk to Rax, he was the
DC-602 guy last I heard.

I do remember them being UAT-centric, but open to the public AFAIK.  Are they
still around?
