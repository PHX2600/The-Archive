I actually localized the phenomenon, it only occurred when calling the central phoenix area (~85016) from an ATT cell phone, and its been happening on and off for weeks now. 

Ill get a recording next time I have the chance because it is a pretty epic failure message.

I had ATT from before they were Cingular up until just after they became ATT again.  I never liked them.  They seemed to have problems like this every other month, their coverage was terrible, and while I never had to call customer service (I was under my moms plan), she would bitch about their lack of customer support all the time.

While I recognize that it has been a while since then, because of that experience and how great (in comparison) Verizon has been to me, I'll probably never go back to ATT.  There are my two cents.

Personally never had an issue with them. Awesome coverage and fast 3G Speeds (Speed tests up to 3-4Megabits per sec.)

Drove from Spokane to Phoenix and only had an outage around Montana (Nothin through there) and I have full service (Internet Txting and phone) Costs me only 45 bucks a month =D

I am running a Sony X1a and never had an issue.
