## In need of servo cables
Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Sat February 27th, 2010 02:07:48 PM

I'm in dire need of some servo cables, specifically female to female style. I realize they are only a couple bucks each but I though there might be someone out there who has a few they could donate to my cause.

Thanks.
