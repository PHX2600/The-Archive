## Safety Deposit Boxes
Posted by **Rax** on Fri May 14th, 2010 03:00:14 PM

I just got a safety deposit box today. The box comes with two keys, that the
financial institution says they don't have copies for.

The keys were kind of interesting: brass, about 2mm thick, and square cuts. The
most interesting thing (I think) is that the two keys aren't 100% identical, as
you'll see in this pic:

(Note that I marked the one key black, so the difference in the length of the
(keys could be seen.

Just thought I'd pass along this observation.

Oh I am sure they have copies to them in some fashion but there is a possibility
they don't and they drill them if the owner is ever not found. Old banks of the
past didn't have copies and they would be slowly discovered and opened over time
by new owners of the vaults.

I know this is way late but the safety deposit boxes are lever locks, as long as
the levers are lifted to the correct height all is well. The keys not being
identical is a little odd, but as long as they both work. They make a lot of
tools to decode, pick or pull the lock. Lockmasters has a few here

The cool part is that all you need is some flat steel and a dremel to duplicate
them ;)
