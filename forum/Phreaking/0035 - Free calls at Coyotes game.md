## Free calls at Coyotes game
Posted by **dual** on Sat January 26th, 2008 10:17:14 PM

Had tickets for the "Qwest Luxury Suite Level" at Jobing arena and Qwest were
kind enough to provide free local calls. Reorder on toll calls. CPN is
623-772-3200, the main number. Pics...

Cool! Lucky dude.

I was at the marquee and was messing with their "Free Phone" that is to be used
to call cabs if you are trashed, I found that dialing */#3(areacode+number) (I
cant remember whether it was pound or star) would let you make free phone calls
outside of taxi services. *edit: CPN for the free phone @ marquee theater:
602-443-0153

I also ran into the same "free phone" at some large go cart place where I did
some merchant training through radioshack.

I guess I'll just have to get some VIP tickets and do some MF*'n manual
scanning!

Also, we should move the phreak ref. over to the new forums, I forgot what CPN
stood for (calling party number), and I'm not afraid to admit it! ;)

I second that emotion!

I merged the old thread into a new post
[here](http://www.phx2600.org/forum2/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=56) - Mods, it might
be kewl to sticky that so it doesn't get lost later on. ^_-.

Woh, that's a good find! They have those all over, cause they're free. I wonder
if that trick works on all of them or if it's a customizable option in the
payphone.

Thanks! If you can test it out, that would be cool, I really don't get to run
into them often.
