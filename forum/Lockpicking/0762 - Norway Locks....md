## Norway Locks...
Posted by **LosT** on Wed March 4th, 2009 11:17:18 PM

A few lock stories from the Norway trip:

  1. Norway uses vastly superior locks to our own.They are much harder to pick-
  keyway is difficult, keys are longer, deeper cuts, safety pins, etc...
  2. So in our hotel we tried the "I locked my key in my room" trick on the
  hotel- they blindly gave us the 'master' for that floor to get back into our
  rooms.We also managed to get hi-res pics of all of our keys for duping (just
  as an exercise in fun)-

I'll try to get the images up so you can see the Norwegian keys...

Nice, I have always contested that is doesn't matter how secure your lock is
there is always an easier way to get in. That is interesting that they still use
conventional keys.
