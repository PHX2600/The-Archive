I never really used Skype, but I would if someone could give me a good reason to.  So convince me, and I'll get it.

I don't know if i can convince anyone to use it, but i'll try.

Skype is an easy to use Instant Messenger. You can easily send text, urls, and files. Then, you can have voice chat with people in your skype contact list. You can also have video chat. You can also have text and voice conferencing, text conferencing works kind of like an irc chat channel. Voice chat works like a conference call. Skype.com wants to make money, so they will bridge your im to landlines and cellphones for x amount of money (example, unlimited landlines+cellphones in the US and Canada is $2.95/mo).  Also, there are business on skype that will offer services for skype credit. But you don't ever really have to pay to use skype, and I was thinking it's ok for voice teleconferencing for this group.

Good synopsis, now I'm going to play the antagonist:

[quote:y82bvzrn]Instant Messenger[/quote:y82bvzrn]
I already have Pidgin with my AIM, YIM, MSN and GTalk names set up in there (overkill already), why would I need Skype?


[quote:y82bvzrn]Voice chat[/quote:y82bvzrn]
I already have a cell phone and Ventrilo, why would I need Skype?


[quote:y82bvzrn]Video chat[/quote:y82bvzrn]
I don't have a web cam (not applicable to those who do). Why would I need Skype?
(Also, I've heard Pidgin plans on bringing video support to it's 3.0 client (over AIM and MSN at the very least).)


[quote:y82bvzrn]bridge your im to landlines and cellphones for x amount of money[/quote:y82bvzrn]
Again, I have a cell phone I'm already paying for, why would I need Skype?


[quote:y82bvzrn]But you don't ever really have to pay to use skype[/quote:y82bvzrn]
Didn't you just say they &quot;bridge your im to landlines and cellphones for x amount of money&quot;?  Sounds like paying to me.

To clear that up, you can use skype for free by not using skype to make telephone calls.

Anyway, I don't work for skype, so why would I take so much time arguing to make people use it. If anyone else out there has it, it's got me!

Asterisk is fun.  We set up an asterisk box in lab for my Voice/VoIP class in college.  We set up voice mail boxes.  The ability to dial in from a cell phone to an internal VoIP phone.  Set up an auto attendant (voice prompts at the beginning), and much more.

I have Gtalk and that mofo works! It's part of the reason why I want that T-mobile G1 phone.
