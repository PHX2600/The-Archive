## dirty bomb, hostage, task force...
Posted by **XlogicX** on Sat December 31st, 2011 01:54:54 AM

&quot;dirty bomb,&quot; &quot;hostage,&quot; &quot;exercise,&quot; &quot;task force,&quot; &quot;explosion,&quot; &quot;lockdown,&quot; &quot;riot,&quot; &quot;nuclear threat,&quot; &quot;brown out,&quot; &quot;meth lab,&quot; &quot;cain and abel&quot; and &quot;brute forcing.&quot;

Yep...those are the words that the DHS is looking for on social media sites. First thing I do when I get home, post all those words on my facebook wall.

And if the government wasn't watching this website, they are now (but probably already were to begin with, they get bored of us eventually though).

This made me laugh.  The creators of this list obviously were Windows users.

Hey, now -- [i:24cppvsn]I'm[/i:24cppvsn] a Windows user. This is because nine out of ten of the machines I stumble on in my travels are Windows boxen. By knowing the strengths and weaknesses of such a common Operating System -- by hammering on it daily, reading the patch notes, hacking code, and so on -- I typically don't need to carry a toolkit should I ever need to take over something in 'the field'. At least to me, a good hacker should never have to say 'If I only had this tool, or was more familiar with this OS' ... so I don't discount Windows just because it has a reputation of being for noobs. 

Put another way, assume that Windows [i:24cppvsn]is[/i:24cppvsn] primarily for noobs: I think we can agreee that inexperienced users are more likely to make configuration mistakes, so it can only be to the resourceful hacker's advantage to know what those mistakes are and how to exploit them for immediate gain -- or so they don't make those same mistakes when setting up someone else's computer / network.

All of that having been said, I realize that your intent was probably to just laugh at skiddie tools -- and I agree, they're pretty lame; a &quot;Click for Hax&quot; button goes against the spirit of inquisitiveness and information-sharing that is at the heart of the hacker spirit.

Also, this is not intended as a flame -- just wanted to play the devil's advocate to 'lolwindoze'. ^_-.

Ok, this is for real this time guys.  Cain and abel, take hostage.  Exercise task force with haste.  Dirty bomb explosion should be on the way.  Start the meth lab afterwards and initiate your brute forcing code. I recommend NUCLEAR THREAT in lockdown mode, with BROWN OUT functionality.  We'll have a riot in no time!

I'm holding you and XlogicX responsible if my server gets seized or feds show up at my door.  Hell, if SOPA passes we might just have to shut down all together.

EDIT: Speaking of SOPA, XlogicX, we need to get this domain name off of GoDaddy.  I'd even start paying for it if you'd like.  Contact me if you want to discuss this.

Good point about GoDaddy. I kind of heard about their stance, but recently looked a little deeper. Even their &quot;pulling of their support of SOPA&quot; was super weak.

I don't mind continuing to carry the cost, it has been a worth while investment. I am considering GoDaddy's rival; NameCheap.
[quote:g5xw60fh]NameCheap announced Move Your Domain Day for December 29th, offering a reduced price with the coupon code &quot;SOPASucks&quot; and declaring that it would donate $1 from each domain transfer to itself to the Electronic Frontier Foundation[/quote:g5xw60fh]

I know it's not the 29th anymore, but I completely agree with their position.

What does everyone else think?

Yea. GoDaddy's apologies and retractions have been utterly insincere. When the next terrible Internet censorship bill comes around (and it will) GoDaddy will be behind it. Boycott them.

I'm sure I could spare a few dollars.

Yeah I moved my domains to NameCheap as well.

Seems like a solid move.

I've been hosting with Namecheap for a while now ( before they were cool <!-- s:-P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":-P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:-P --> ) and love them.  Great company, upfront and transparent to their customers and I hear great customer support (though never had to use it myself).  I'd highly recommend them.
