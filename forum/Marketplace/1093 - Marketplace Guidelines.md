## Marketplace Guidelines
Posted by **PHLAK** on Sat September 5th, 2009 11:38:38 AM

The following are some guidelines that should be followed when posting items for
sale or for request.

  * Do not attempt to sell anything illegal (ie - drugs, nuclear weapons,
    prostitution, etc.).
  * If possible, please include an item description and picture of your product
    and/or a link to the same product on another site (ie - Newegg)
  * Please clearly note the price of an item whether it's $100 or FREE-99
  * When your item is sold/given away, please note that in the thread somewhere
    and lock the post (I'm pretty sure everyone can lock their own posts, if not
    let me know)
  * When possible, administrators will do their best to avoid scammers, however
    it's not possible to catch them all. ALL SALES/PURCHASES ARE DONE AT YOUR
    OWN RISK!

Thanks in advanced for following the rules.  F*** you in advanced for breaking
them.
