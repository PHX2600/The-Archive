Ya know, I thought of meatspin or lemonparty, but that would be to gratuitously obvious. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

The other idea was a link to YouTube with "Do You Want to Date My Avatar," but I figured everyone was burned out on that by now.

Yeah, I was burnt out on that before I finished the video.  But I do like the avatar.
