## Track Me If You Can

Just watched an episode of &quot;Track Me If You Can&quot; on the Discovery channel. Wasn't half bad. It's essentially about how to stay hidden from the law while being a fugitive. Using pre-paid phones, switching your shopping habits, avoiding putting fingerprints on things, etc... Boring.

But they also had real neat hackish stuff. Like rigging a hat with bright IRLEDs to blind CCTVs. They showed TOR and said that you can use it to anonymize your browsing. 

If you happen to be watching TV and it's on, I'd recommend giving it a shot. It's really tinfoil-hatish kind of paranoia material, but we all love that stuff. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->
