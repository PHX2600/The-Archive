Hi y'all! 

I came across something mighty interesting upon logging out of my email...

<http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/create-your-google-profile.html>

I hate to point this out to the Googster but this profile thingy makes dropping docs sooo much easier <!-- s:o --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /><!-- s:o --> 

What's everyone elses take on it (assuming you clicked the link, of course) ?

The Illuminati can look wherever they want, I have no fear, that's just a projection of our slave self anyway, not our natural self.
