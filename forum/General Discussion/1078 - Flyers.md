## Flyers
Posted by **PHLAK** on Sat August 22nd, 2009 01:00:31 PM

So Kilo came up with a great idea at Diggnation AZ and I wanted to act upon that.  He suggested that we should have flyers to pass around at events like Diggnation to bring more people to the meetings.  So I'm starting to create a flyer and will put it up in PDF form for anyone to print, but first wanted some input from everyone else as to what we should put on it.

The following is what I've come up with so far:

[b:2z6az487]Who:[/b:2z6az487] Anyone - open to the public
[b:2z6az487]What:[/b:2z6az487] Hacking, Coding, Lock Picking, Social Engineering, Phreaking, Urban Exploration, Hardware Moding
[b:2z6az487]Where:[/b:2z6az487] Unlimited Coffee - 741 E Glendale Ave. Phoenix, AZ 85020
[b:2z6az487]When:[/b:2z6az487]Meetings start at 6pm on the first Friday of every month and go until the last person leaves
[b:2z6az487]Why:[/b:2z6az487] Because hackers are people too (and we love caffeine)!

And at the bottom I have a link to the site so people can get more information.

So, if anyone can think of more info to put on the flyer, please let me know.

Does the bar code and the hex and the binary in the background say anything or is it just for show.

EDIT

the binary:
MOTHER FUCKER

the hex:
I'm glad I didn't have to type that hex out to figure out what it said. 

the bar code:
Isn't any of the formats I tried, if it does mean something I don't know what.

I looked back at my tweets and realized it was you that mentioned this.  Sorry about that.

[quote=&quot;Automated Penguin&quot;:2e0nicau]the binary:

LOL!

(For others: That's not actually what it says, but his reaction to it)

[quote=&quot;Automated Penguin&quot;:2e0nicau]the bar code:

I found some font online, so the barcode may not be accurate. It should translate to &quot;phx2600.org&quot;. Is there a good online barcode generator that will generate a real barcode at a high-ish resolution?

Updated the barcode.  See if you can read it now.

And it's bigger this time around too (but further from where I live).

Which 'old' coffee shop are you guys referring to?

Posted by **PHLAK** on Mon August 24th, 2009 10:28:32 PM

I was talking about Counter Culture.  It's re-opening in Tempe in the near future.

Great to hear. And nice to know it'll will be closer to me as well.

Another reason you should move down to Tempe, where AZ haxors seem to gravitate towards.  <!-- s8-) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /><!-- s8-) -->

I think that the bar code, binary, and hex should actually mean something; or else it really is just for show. Even the circuit on the phoenix logo was taken off of something, I wont mention any specifics &lt;trivia&gt;(but it's one of them circuits that count down, then something happens when it gets to zero)&lt;/trivia&gt;.

I also agree with the idea of a flyer. I remember Evil1 was talking about this a while back, I don't think anything came out of it, but a great idea none-the-less.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Evil1** on Fri August 28th, 2009 05:12:05 PM

No, its called PHOENIX 2600, not TEMPE 2600.

Oh... it does.

I agree.

Well, I guess we will have to change that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Ugly** on Fri August 28th, 2009 09:40:08 PM

My vote is for &quot;The Phoenix/Mesa/Scottsdale metropolitan statistical area 2600&quot; or PMSMSA2600 (or PMSMSA2K6 if you wanna be even cooler about it)

It just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?

PHX2600 is fine even if we meet in a suburb. We used to meet at the AZ Mills mall when I first started going. Although, it was called AZ2600 back then, but that's a long story anyway. I think that regardless of suburb, it should be named after the big main city. I guess it is a personal preference, but If I were to live in Astoria, I would still say that I live in New York. I know some people would still say they live in Astoria, and if they moved to the island, I would require them not to say they live in New York, but that they live on Manhattan (just to be consistent with how ridiculously specific they want to be).

Tempe isn't really a suburb due to it having its own downtown.  But yeah, PHX as an abbreviations seems to refer to the airport code, which means the entire metro area.  I've seem PDX used in a similar fashion for basically all of northwest Oregon.

I have no issue with having PHX2600 named what it is and be located someplace with a more concentrated hacker demographic, but the current location is fine.
