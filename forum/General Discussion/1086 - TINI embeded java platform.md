## TINI embeded java platform
Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Sat August 29th, 2009 04:12:25 PM

I have about 3 of these things, I got them from a coworker at ASU, they used to use them to teach the embedded computing courses. Its a small Single inline package module with about 70 pins, you can write programs for it in java and it has built in networking, it does multitasking, and it has a built in OS with a telnet and FTP server. Its a pretty fancy module. It also comes with built in libraries to do one wire communications and direct IO to the pins. 

I would be willing to loan a couple out with dev boards and a power supply module and all the software and documentation you need if anyone's interested. The only stipulation is you must do something with it. If you're not gonna use it or aren't willing to spend the time to develop on it I' not gonna lend one out. So if you want one let me know but i will expect a presentation or forum thread later showing me what you did with it

I have successfully written code for a few of these modules including an HTTP client and server, so they do work and they are kick ass.
