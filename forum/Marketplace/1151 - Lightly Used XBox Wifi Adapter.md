## Lightly Used XBox Wifi Adapter
Posted by **dxh** on Thu November 12th, 2009 07:18:54 PM

Hey guys,

I have a wired connection for my DRM-tastic xbox elite, and no longer need my wireless adapter, which is specially made for the xbox.  It retails for OVER $90.00, but I'm willing to sell it to you 1/3 the price at $30 USD.  Specs can be found here:

Device is made to be confifured directly from the xbox.

I'll try to remember to bring it to the meeting in December.
