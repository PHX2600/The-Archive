I've been reading a book about the history of pirate radio and it got me remembering about a pirate station i used to listen to growing up and how cool I thought the concept was. But then I got thinking with the ease of internet radio and podcast is the concept of a pirate radio broadcast even relevent anymore?

I guess it depends on where you are at. I am sure in south america and africa and in poor regions where internet is slim, pirate radio does great.

Depends on the content.  If there was a pirate electronic/techno/trance station I'd probably listen to it in my car every day (though probably not much if at all from home).  On the other hand, if it were a pirate pop/rap/country station I'd avoid it like the plague.
