Was looking into it this weekend and found some stuff about amatuer radio and was wondering if anyone has one of a license or knows anything about it.
Maybe we could have a forum about it i.e. radio tv cell phones and such that uses the airwaves.

A lot of us have the aptitude for it, perhaps we should organize some study and testing for HAM licensing.

I think Nak has/had a Ham operating license, you should talk to him.

Well if you get a ham radio license, it just means you are legally able to experiment/communicate/and just USE [url=http://www.radiotimeline.com/n2knl-USbands.gif:3o0fzyht]certain frequencies of the EM spectrum>.

Some interesting things with ham radio:

And just like talking to people (phone), chewing bacon... morse code (CW)... other data like RTTY, PSK31

BUT... that's not the limit! The only limit is your WONDERFUL imagination! (as long as you don't break the rules, and get pwnd by the FCC, no music, cuss words, discussing illegal activities etc etc) I really haven't done anything besides voice operation on 2 meters and 440...

You mentioned that you "worked with over the air signals for a while" in the TV hijack thread, I was wondering what kind of work?
