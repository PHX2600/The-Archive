## Transformer Houses

Nar, not like Optimus Prime. Apparently in the 50s and 60s electrical companies would put facades over substations so they'd look like hauses (Or ... Mouse =&gt; Mice, House =&gt; Hice?). Here's a link with some pictures:

And, as always, the text in case it goes down (for some reason):

In 1987, Canadian photographer Robin Collyer began documenting houses that aren't houses at all – they're architecturally-disguised electrical substations, complete with windows, blinds, and bourgeois landscaping. 

&quot;During the 1950s and 1960s,&quot; Collyer explains in a recent issue of Cabinet Magazine, &quot;the Hydro-Electric public utilities in the metropolitan region of Toronto built structures known as 'Bungalow-Style Substations.' These stations, which have transforming and switching functions, were constructed in a manner that mimics the style and character of the different neighborhoods.&quot;

Simulacra meant to reflect how it looks to be domestic and Canadian, &quot;there are about 100 of these structures located on residential streets in the central and the suburban parts of the greater Toronto area.&quot; Pictured here are only five of them. So if you live in suburban Toronto and your neighbor's house is humming – perhaps now you know what's really going on inside.
 
Meanwhile, the address 555 Spadina – i.e. the third image, above – shows up in this list of 322 properties owned by the city of Toronto. If anyone out there knows something about the other 321 buildings, be in touch!

Here's a link from the article to the work of Robin Collyer:

I have previously seen pictures of an (abandoned?) oil rig being disguised as a building:

And I'm sure everyone's probably heard of cell fone and radio towers being disguised as trees, but just in case:

But, yar, transformers disguised as multi-level homes is a new one to me. O_o!

Very cool! I haven't heard of that either, thanks for sharing.  I also love the pictures of cellphone towers disguised as trees, I know there is one in a church cross near my old house.

His light shines (and carries your texts!)

Those cell towers look horrible too. Reminds me of the picture that you drew for my stego presentation <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->, you can totally tell it's not a tree.
