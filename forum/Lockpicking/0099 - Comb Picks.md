## Comb Picks
Posted by **ThatGuy** on Tue April 22nd, 2008 01:17:53 AM

These are comb picks. They are used to push the bottom pin all of the way up into the bible of the plug. This allows the sheer line to be free of any pins, thus allowing the plug to turn freely. They are very easy to use, simply stick them into the lock and lift all of the way up, then turn. 

There are a few downsides to this technique, for one there must be enough space in the chamber of the bible to accommodate the spring, top pin, and bottom pin. If the top pin or bottom pin are to large and the spring cannot compress enough. Then the lock will bind on the bottom pin, not allowing the plug to turn.

They come in all shapes and sizes and will work on a very large number of locks to quickly defeat standard pin tumbler locks. The great part is that security pins such as spool or serrated have no effect on foiling this attack. They are also very usefull on certain locks that have tight key ways, that make normal picking extremely difficult.

now that's interesting! I should've saved this lock that I've been trying to pick for a while, I finally gave up last time I was cleaning my room and squirted some high concentration nitric acid into it, which didn't destroy the pins either, so I just trashed it... maybe I'll go find another one sometime and bring it to the meeting and have you take a look at it <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->
