## Fourth Awakening People's Army
Posted by **jargon** on Mon March 1st, 2010 04:00:37 AM

Kinda let a cat out of the bag, and now several million or more people may
attempt to attend the March 5th 2009 Phoenix 2600 meet-up and every meet-up
there-after. (I ask of you to please not be dick admins like you have in the
past by censoring this sort of stuff.)

Hopefully, the database and server doesn't fry when people start joining the
forums, and that the entire megaopolis doesn't end up in a SHTF scenario where
the military has to be called in handling the millions upon millions flooding
the city from all over the world attempting to attend the meet-up and all future
meet-ups.

Or perhaps, thank goodness I sniped the mass-media marketability of that joyous
"hacking" group.

COINTELPRO, BITCHES.

..or whatever the Hell that FBI thing was.

Antimeme would be proud of me if they weren't such tools.
