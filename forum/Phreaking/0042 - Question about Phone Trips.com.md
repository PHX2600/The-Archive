## Question about Phone Trips.com
Posted by **binfordman** on Fri February 1st, 2008 10:15:14 PM

Does anyone know the type of system that was used on the mp3 &quot;how evan doorbell became a phone phreak&quot; part 5 and he reached the conference that was very loud? I'm starting to think thats something related to a business and I have no clue what that noise was when people joined. 

Funny how that number &quot;FELIX&quot; gave out turns out to be a payphone number in the NY/NJ area. 

Also, is the owner of that site going to be releasing more new stuff soon? 

Thanks, B

I've never heard of <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.phonetrips.com">http://www.phonetrips.com</a><!-- m --> , I'll check it out!

Haha, I like this (from his main page wideweb.com):

Are there any other players that play .ram files besides real?  I am looking for a player for real video as well, my friend wanted me to watch some physics lectures, but they were in real video format! <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( -->

There is a link (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="ftp://ftp.wideweb.com/GroupBell/">ftp://ftp.wideweb.com/GroupBell/</a><!-- m -->) where you can download high quality versions of the recordings in MP3, which is what I did. (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="ftp://ftp.wideweb.com/GroupBell/HowBPhreak1HQ.zip">ftp://ftp.wideweb.com/GroupBell/HowBPhreak1HQ.zip</a><!-- m --> in particular)

I'm 15 minutes in, awesome  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->  highly recommended!

Nak, Media Player Classic will play .ram files but you may need to set it in options, as I did, or enter the link directly from the Open files menu.  It comes with Quick Alternative, another good program to be using to deal with annoying .mov files without the other hassles.  It's possible you may need to install a codec for MPC to work with playing .ram files.  It's also very useful for other kinds of obscure media types, like Matroska audio files.  I play the movie Battle Royale with this player.  Though I'm pretty sure I had to install codecs there.

p.s. Isn't this a phreaking topic?

I don't know what this would fall into. The forms seem so dead I thought &quot;off topic&quot; would be more suitable for it. 
I've been meaning to put the .mp3s on my site but I don't know if Evan would appreciate it. 

I've been backing them up on DVD here because sites like this don't last forever! 

(and yes, the downloaded mp3's are not labeled properly, either unless he updated it)

Oh well, these forums have been up for only a little while (and go through times of silence)... the old forums are full of goodies.

I noticed after I finished listening to the first file that you were talking about the 5th in the series, whoops, either way I think I'll listen all the way through until the end.  Tickled me good!

Feel free to put this in the phreaking section. 
I felt this was sorta off topic

What type of phone system was that in the conference in #5? I'm still thinking it's a business PBX. He still didn't release part 6 

I can't believe how high quality that conf' was!

I just downloaded the 6th episode from the FTP <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="ftp://ftp.wideweb.com/GroupBell/HowBPhreak6HQ.zip">ftp://ftp.wideweb.com/GroupBell/HowBPhreak6HQ.zip</a><!-- m -->

and I just finished listening to the 5th file, and the way I understood it: The &quot;conference&quot; was a telco test line of some sort, he was mentioning crossbar switching <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbar_switch">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbar_switch</a><!-- m --> and how ma bell used the tones and voice threats to discourage use.  Dual may know, but I am clueless to what that line would be used for besides party ;D

I think i meant to say part 7. Looked at my folder and have all 6 parts. 
Could you trace a persons line with that tone? 

I did a look up of that phone number (pending it was New Jersey) and it turned out to be a payphone (the # the person gave out in the conference)
