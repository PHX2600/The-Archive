- alias jargon's The Ultimate Unlimited Coffee Survival Guide -

my custom coffee costs roughly 8 dollars.

the same size soda cup is roughly 1 dollar.

i usually tip between 20% and 50%.

you have unlimited refills from the soda machine per visit.

you save 1$ on a coffee refill using the same cup.

do this:

buy the coffee for 8 bucks.

reuse the coffee cup for soda refills and coffee refills, remember it doesn't matter how big the cup is, you have infinite refills. this means you can give a higher ratio tip, plus you only use one cup your entire visit.

cafe spends less money on cups and less cups go into landfills.

also the servers make higher income due to being able to spend a ratio of the cost of a single soda as tip.

win all around.

i am at the cafe between 6 and 18 hours every time i go.

now the whatburger two store fronts down the street, instead of purchasing a triple meat with triple cheese just purchase 3 just a burgers with cheese, you save 2 or 3 bucks, and are allowed to bring food from that whatburger into the cafe.

further benefits, reuse the same cup the next visit to still get roughly 1$ discount straight off the bat, even more ratio of savings you can use to tip the server with, and even less cups that have to be ordered for inventory and later placed into landfills.

disclaimer: this only works with iced coffee.

further benefits: keep a discount card so when you purchase 10 drinks/refills you get the 11th drink/refill for free!

additional benefits: if you offer computer help and they offer to pay you, suggest they purchase you an Unlimited Coffee gift card, which is more likely to be done that outright cash, due to unlimited coffee vouchers obviously not going toward fruitless expenditures, and also showing that you may be at the cafe to help them out again sometime.

advanced benefits: eventually the staff will trust you enough to keep a running daily tab!

specialty coordination: don't just fetch food at whataburger, offer the server that you are willing to make a run to buy food for them food too; they may simply tell you to keep the change! this also increases their trust of you paying off a daily tab before you leave!

expert coordination: volunteer to assist tidying up the outdoor smoking patio furniture and emptying the ashtrays at closing! this gains lots of bonding points, and possibly grants staying after hours while the janitor cleans up.
