For a city the size of Phoenix these boards are relatively quiet....

That's a shame...

oh well. It could be way worse, at least its the boards that arent getting much traffic and not the meetings.

The boards are kind of seasonal.  Usually traffic spikes around Defcon time and in the latter part of the year (Oct - Dec).  But I agree with Maxwell, at least the meetings aren't falling apart.
