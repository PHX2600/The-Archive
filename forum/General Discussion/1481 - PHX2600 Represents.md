## PHX2600 Represents
Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Mon October 24th, 2011 11:13:55 AM

In September I demoed some fun projects at the ASU Poly tech campus and forgot to make a post about it.

I presented my [https://github.com/Penguin2600/AetherTap](AetherTap) platform with some servo control via android fun.

Also the kinect demos which some of you saw at previous meetings.

And finally I had my Jacobs ladder with me. 4+ feet of fun plasma arc action.

Anyway here are some [http://www.blastwavelabs.com/files/index.php?dir=Images/polypresentation090811/](pics) of the enthralled masses. I also had the phx2600 URL on the demo screen and a small stack of fliers out.

IS that a chocolate chip cookie sandwich you're eating in picture 3? Looks like two slices of oddly shaped bread with a cookie on the inside. Looks delicious. XD

Pretty cool stuff! I can't seem to make out what you mean by your Jacob's Ladder, though. Plasma arcing sounds like too much fun to be true.

You're going to bring your chocolate chip sandwich to the meeting? Great!

It was actually 2 quesadilla wedges and a cookie.

Not bad.
