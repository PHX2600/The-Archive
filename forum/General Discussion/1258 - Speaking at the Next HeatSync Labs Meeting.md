HAY [LADEEZ | GUISE],

In case if anyone is interested, I'm speaking at our friendly neighborhood hacker space, HeatSync Labs, on July 1st on Haystack Project, which pretty much everyone already knows about, but just in case, here be the deets: [url:8bxfh5kp]http&#58;//www&#46;heatsynclabs&#46;org/this-thursday-hardware-free-search-engine-shenanigans/[/url:8bxfh5kp].

Anyway, just thought I'd share.

KTHXBYE
