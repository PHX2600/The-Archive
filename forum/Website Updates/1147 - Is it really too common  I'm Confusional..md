> The following words in your search query were ignored because they are too
common words: **python**. You must specify at least one word to search for. Each
word must consist of at least 3 characters and must not contain more than 14
characters excluding wildcards.

Unfortunately the PHPBB search is pretty lame.  Try using the search box at the
top right of the page, it uses Google which, while not perfect, is substantially
better.  Example:
[search for "python"](http://www.phx2600.org/search/?cx=partner-pub-2614997598856289%3A81nadhhmes4&cof=FORID%3A9&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=python&sa=#728)

Ah, but that still doesn't list all the Python code posted here. :P At least, I
don't think it does... I remember there being more.

Probably true.  I haven't come up with a good search solution yet, short of
writing my own search functionality, but that would take time I do not have.

Wouldn't it be possible to change the behavior of PHPBB not to exclude a term
like 'python'?  That would probably the easiest fix, I'd think.

I think it must be a conspiracy of the python haters because you also cant
attach .py files to forum posts, wtf.
