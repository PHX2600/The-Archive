This is really cool. I wondered a while back if this would work when I saw the technique demonstrated with an old lock box key blank that was flat just like a credit card. HPC and a few other companies use to sell spare plastic car keys that are the same size as a credit card. I bet this would work with some other HS style locks as well.

That's impressive!

The techniques used to open supposedly &quot;100% Secure&quot; doors and locks are getting better and better each day.

I will also add this note it is not as easy to do as they make it out to be. This stuff is sort of like the media hype on everything, but if you have access to look at the original key that long and take a picture, why not take 2 pictures and generate a  real key from scratch or mold. I could do it from a picture alone but not the average Joe without multiple tries. It still is very damaging to show how a restricted blank can me compromised.
