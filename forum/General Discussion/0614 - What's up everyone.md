## What's up everyone
Posted by **Problem Child** on Fri October 10th, 2008 04:54:02 PM

Just dropping a formal "Hello" to everyone on the forum. I moved to Phoenix about a year ago..but sadly I didn't come across this site until recently.  I was reading 2600 on the airplane and realized there are meetings in Phoenix.  Better late than never!  <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

WELCOME PROBLEM CHILD!

Always glad to get new members!  Hopefully I'll be able to attend next months meeting and we can meet formally.  If you have any questions, let us know, we'd love to help.

Trying to stay out of trouble. <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: --> 

I just picked up an overclocked 9800GTX at Best Buy.  It was on clearance for $150 and I desperately needed to dump my old 7900GS.  With dual dual-link DVI outputs I'm thinking a second 30" monitor would be a good investment..  <!-- s:twisted: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><!-- s:twisted: -->

Welcome.  I'm looking at buying a new computer now.  

I don't usually attend the meetings for transportation reasons, but I usually stop by here on occasion.
