This phone is in pristine condition except for a few light scratches on the battery cover that are hardly noticeable unless you're looking for them. I applied the Zagg shield a few days after getting the phone and used a cheap VZW screen cover until then so the screen is 100% scratch free.

What would be the right price?

Something close to the cost of a like-new Droid I suppose.  Or something more then the phone is worth new.

Got me a Droid, updated post to selling instead of trading.
