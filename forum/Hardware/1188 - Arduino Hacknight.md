## Arduino Hacknight
Posted by **dxh** on Wed January 6th, 2010 02:07:53 PM

Since I know how much you all LOVE the Arduino platform <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->, I thought I'd share that every first Wednesday of the month is Arduino Hacknight at Gangplank.  Linkage: [url:21oclh5b]http&#58;//www&#46;heatsynclabs&#46;org/?p=265[/url:21oclh5b].

Anyway, if you want to stop by and start converting everyone to PIC controllers, feel free.

Did you end up stopping by?  We were all in the conference room; Didn't realize it took place in the conference room until I randomly wandered in.  They're doing another Arduino night next month though.
