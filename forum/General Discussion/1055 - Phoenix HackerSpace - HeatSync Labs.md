## Phoenix HackerSpace - HeatSync Labs
Posted by **uberschnitzel** on Mon August 10th, 2009 01:36:08 AM

A group of friends and I had been tossing around the idea of a HackerSpace over the last 2 years.  Just recently we decided we wanted to make this a reality.  The concept for HeatSync Labs came out of the desire for a couple of us to get together and continue working on projects after college.  We wanted a place that we could go to where we could share tools, space, and ideas with fellow hackers and makers.  Over the last year or so we heard of a couple other notably successful hacker spaces popping up across the states(NoiseBridge, Pumping Station: One, NYCResistor, and HacDC) and wondered what was holding us back.  We wanted to join in on the fun.  Over the last two months we've visited Noisebridge, Pumping Station: One, and met with members of other established HackerSpaces at the recent Defcon 17.  Through all of this we've been collecting information that we can utilize in a HackerSpace of our own.

If any of you are interested in this concept we will be hosting our 2nd Public meeting this Thursday at 8pm at the following location:

Mesa F.O.P. Lodge
1452 E. Main St., Mesa, AZ 85203
<http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=1452+E.+Main+St.,+Mesa,+AZ+85203+&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;z=16>

We will be discussing:

1. The Hacker Space idea, what it means to us and the fun that can be had.
2. What direction we intend to go with the group.
3. Getting started on finding a location to lease/purchase for the HackerSpace.
4. A couple current projects.
5. A means to collaborate on projects while looking for a space.
6. Poll for contacts for legal(non-profit) and accounting expertise.

Snacks, drinks and good company will be provided!

Don't think I'll make it to the meet, it's a little far out for me, but I definitely would like to hear more.

I'd go, but 20 miles is my limit. Any more and it takes too fuckin long to get there and back.
