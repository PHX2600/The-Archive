I'm trying to find it at a bookstore, it was mentioned a lot in this EXCELLENT book 'Prometheus Rising', which I just finished reading.

I found it on google book search: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=CTrT6wh172AC&amp;dq=Finnegan%27s+Wake&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=v7YJSvbYE5K6tAONu7HqCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#PPA3,M1">http://books.google.com/books?id=CTrT6w ... =4#PPA3,M1</a><!-- m -->

Madness dear friends, is actually happiness

The internet is a wonderful thing: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Finnegans-Wake-Penguin-Modern-Classics/dp/014118311X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1242154415&amp;sr=1-1">http://www.amazon.com/Finnegans-Wake-Pe ... 415&amp;sr=1-1</a><!-- m -->

And I agree with Penguin, Nak would of probably been able to find it.

That google book link is actually a link to the book (Nak actually sent that link to me, you guys are ridiculously smart, we should  meet up next time I'm in phoenix!!)

Nak actually left for phx yesterday, should be there for about a week.

I was searching for a good stuff to read and enjoy my vacation. i think &quot;Prometheus Rising&quot; will be good one.
