## Tiger Team Old TV Show
Posted by **ThatGuy** on Sat October 9th, 2010 12:32:59 AM

One of my old favorite short lived TV shows. A must see for any security
penetration enthusiast

The show follows a civilian tiger team composed of Chris Nickerson, Luke McOmie,
and Ryan Jones, which is hired to infiltrate organizations with the objective of
testing their weaknesses to electronic, psychological, tactical, and physical
threats. Attacks executed on organizations in this television show include
social engineering, wired and wireless hacking, and physically breaking into
buildings.

Whats kind of scary is that they are still amateur in many ways. They are doing
things with off the shelf equipment without multi million dollar backing and a
full time R&amp;D support staff.

Penguin just showed me an episode of this show where they break into a car
dealership.  The dealership was pretty secure except for a skylight and a motion
sensor that didn't cover a two foot gap just above the floor.  I really enjoyed
the show.
