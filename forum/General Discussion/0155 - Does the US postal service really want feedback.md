## Does the US postal service really want feedback?

Interestingly, I can't get any zipcode combo to work with this online survey from USPS:  

<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://gx.gallup.com/pos">http://gx.gallup.com/pos</a><!-- m -->
(website was on my receipt from a package I mailed)

I guess this is a good way to avoid all negative feedback.   <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

I hate the post office as far as security goes, like George Carlin said "They don't give a fuck about you"

Ok, finally figure it out. I'm suppose to use the zip code and number at the top of the receipt, not mine.  And here I thought I discovered a conspiracy.  <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

Interesting survey.  Here's how I answered part of it:
