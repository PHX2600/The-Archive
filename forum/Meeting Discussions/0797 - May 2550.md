I might be there, to make up for my absence at the last 2600 meeting.

Just a quick head's up. There's a 99% chance jargon will attend. In all probability then, the 2550 is moved to lux coffee bar.

Is there any way 2500 type spur-of-the-moment meetings and their shifting locations could be announced on the phx2600 twitter account?  That'd be convenient to my interests...  <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

I recall that this was twittered, but not by the PHX2600 account.  I think it was nytebrew who mentioned it, and only a select few have access to the @PHX2600 account, one being me, and I should have posted it, sorry.
