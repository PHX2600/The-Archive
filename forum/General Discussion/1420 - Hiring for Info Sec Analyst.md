## Hiring for Info Sec Analyst
Posted by **InfoSecJob** on Wed June 15th, 2011 11:12:31 AM

Two man Info Sec team missing a member. I am doubtful that we are going to get good applicants (based on where our HR group posted the job) so I figured I would ping this group since I know most of the members here know there stuff. Entry level position. Would love to get someone who is into web app security (parsing code for vulns, using web app scanners, etc.). Passion for info sec is highly valued. PM me for more details.

I applied for a HTML and CSS job, and was denied last week.  I guess I showed too much of a passion for javascript development, or maybe I wasn't cool enough for their hip apple-mac only, app smart iWorld (I wore converse to the interview to try and impress them and told them my five year plan was to join the circus if they wanted me to... I am a pretty good juggler now a days haha)
I don't really have a passion for web-vuln stuff, I know a guy who used to hang around these parts, Dre, he was really into that stuff.  I don't know what I am really interested in... right now it's [url=http://abovesobelow.com/svg/embedSVG.htm:3njz9pjm]SVG and JavaScript> (made that page today), but that's all personal.
I have experience... real world I guess, down and dirty with SQLi (even though I am a newblar at it, I feel like I could learn quite a bit in this area OR 'a' = 'a doesn't cut it, I know, have to know how to dump the tables and the etc etc), I know details of using XMLHttpRequest and XSS to ... uh... write a JS "virus" or worm or...
My mind is pythonic, learned lots about scapy (wrote my own TCP/IP 3way time-able handshaker for the CTF GB100 challenge...)
I would really like to get into understanding C,C++,ASM better, low level languages, memory management, CPU architecture, FPGA that kind of stuff.

To be honest, I'm fine with living on my Dad's couch at the moment and doing my own research, what's this job have in it for me? <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

*EDIT*
ITS A TRAP, THEY'RE TRYING TO CATCH LULZSEC
