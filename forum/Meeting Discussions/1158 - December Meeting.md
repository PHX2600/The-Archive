## December Meeting
Posted by **Rax** on Sun November 22nd, 2009 09:50:30 AM

I was thinking of doing a brief walk-thru/presentation of the Tomato Firmware (Router OS) for Linksys wireless access points.

Any interest in seeing this? 

Also, feel free to post any other December meeting ideas...

I use Tomato on my router, but think this would be great for anyone who doesn't.  People just don't understand the power of custom firmware on a router.

I'd be interested in seeing some custom firmware. Specifically for making an app on.
