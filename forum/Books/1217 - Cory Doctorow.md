Rocks.

'Nuff said. :)

Seriously, though, I've just been getting in to reading his stuff. He's great.
Read some of his stuff sometime.

Oh, yea. I read Little Brother a while back. It's really good. Once the semester
is out, I want to read Makers.

Didn't think of posting here, but you guys recently had "Little
Brother" as a play adaptation on stage in phoenix a few days ago!  If I
were there I would've gone...

I originally wrote that as a joke, but it turned out to be totally true, heh. ;)
Thought about it, forgot for a while, now putting Little Brother on my Christmas
list.

Edit: Nevermind, just did a a bit of serching and came across some [free
downloads](http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/) of it, awesome!

I'm about 5/6 of the way through reading "For the Win" and it's really good.
Would recommend, A+.
