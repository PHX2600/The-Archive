## Nostalgiac Thinking
Posted by **HalfSight** on Sat August 16th, 2008 11:41:16 PM

So I have been thinking lately about thinking like a hacker. I think its something you do from childhood, the way you analyse things and your use of critical thinking. I remember when I was a little boy and I lived with my grandparents. My Grandpa brought home the Apple2 and didn't want us kids messing with it so he locked it up in the guest house so we couldn't get to it. Well, I, with my fascination of this little humming box with its blinking lights and glowing green  screen, wasn't going to be kept at bay. I grabbed one of my grandmas bobby pins and went to the guest room, I removed the little rubber ends and tried picking the lock, and I was successful much to my joy. Well when I got in I really didn't know what to do with it. Here I am about 7 years old in front of this beautiful Apple2, this marvel of engineering, and I didn't have a clue on how to work it. Well this went on for about 2 weeks, me infront of a blank screen with a cursor typing random letters. Well, my grandpa came home early one day and caught me in his computer room. I thought I was in big trouble, but he found my determination to use his computer quite impressing.  He asked my why I had picked my way into the computer and what I wanted to do with his computer, after all I didn't know how to use it. Well, being a little boy I said, &quot;I heard you can play games on these, I want to play games!&quot; So my ol' grampa went down to the computer store and bought some disks and a basic book for making graphical games. My choice was Karate, or Kung Fu or whatever it was called. It took me about 2 weeks to manually type in the code from the book to the computer, about a 1/2 hour a day. Well, I finished and ran the game and to my amazement I was this little green man running around kicking people in their faces!! Now we have xbox's and Playstations and PSP's and nintendo's and computers that can handle massive amounts information. When I think back on my first experience with computers, it makes me realize how far we have actually come in such a short amount of time, and how certain attributes come with certain people.

Awesome story, reminds me of going to savers to pick up BASIC programming books and then pecking the code in <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

Reminds me very much of cracking out code for fellow students to have games or programs on a TI-82.

I probably have many old stories to share, but the TI-82 thing hits close to home.

The TI-82 was the first graphing calculator I got. I didn't have the data link cord, so I also had to program it by hand if I wanted games. I did a search on the early pre-google interwebs for some TI-82 basic games and found many. I programmed nearly all of them into my calculator. The benefit of this is that I started to understand the language just in doing that. When reading the programming manual later, each command made complete sense, and I put nearly the whole manual to memory. I eventually never had to refer to the manual for my own software. I wrote some pretty cool games myself and even a gui shell to launch my programs.

The only scripting and programming I had experience before that was batch scripting and MS Quick BASIC. I couldn't afford development software back then and did not have the skills to get it other ways; that was a long time ago. But I am glad it progressed in this order. Basic for the TI-82 is very limited. I found out early on that having limits increases my creativity. Give me C++ and java and I am overwhelmed with possibilities and in effect do not know what to do with it. In fact, having a whole computer to program is too much for me. Not that I can't, I just don't creatively know where to start.

This is why I like assembly and lower level hardware, there are many restrictions; memory, clock speed, storage, and I/O. You have to start small, but with enough creativity, can do something real big. And the TI-82 was my first experience with those limits, not only that, but it was portable.

First you have to have an idea of what you want to do and second you must have a design. If you have a good design then it just becomes a matter of punching in the code, since you already know the language and what you can do with it. If there's more than one way to do something, go for the clearest way, from a readability standpoint of the software source code. Clarity is often the most appropriate choice, rather then the speediest or the most compact.

I get stuck on issues about how to deliver my software, I think things like &quot;the flash plug-in is so hot, i have to deliver my stuff as a flash applet or the end users won't even try to use it.&quot; That's where I get stuck because of the financial commitment to adobe. Sometime I give up, but sometimes I realize, &quot;Hey, what end-users, nobody but the web spiders are ever gonna see this&quot; and just make a regular downloadable zip file. My friend still targets ms-dos systems he writes for with basic. If he can do that, I can go ahead and target win32 without worrying about being in style.

I did get a TI graphing calculator for school but I haven't played around with it too much. Maybe I'll get around to learning it's basic and/or downloading an assembler for it. Not sure what to do with it, but I do like that it is a portable platform, where it fits in your pocket.

Indeed learn about the TI calculators, they are efficient beasts and one heck of a way to inspire you on programming.
