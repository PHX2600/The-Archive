I think i'm gonna start a bio-hacking project pretty soon, don't know if it will be ready by October or not, but if it is I guess I could bring some of my work along.

Unfortunately I will not be able to attend. I will be out of town that week with work related duties. I should have some new swag for the next meet, and I will be giving away some goodies again. I am sure it will be another fun and excellent meet of great minds as always.

Woah my mind exploded when I thought about that, good job.

Actually I was thinking about trying to breed a fresh water strain of some bioluminescent algae. I don't even know if such a thing is possible without many millions of generations, they do reproduce often but its not sexual so it would be completely mutation based, then slowly reduce the salt levels in some water cells to give natural selection for fresh water an edge.

Anyone have experience with this stuff at all? I don't I'm just guessing at how to do it.

I'll PM it to you. Work in progress though. I would have had more done if it weren't for playing so many video games for the last month.
