A man hacked the live display at a train station in The Netherlands to show his phone's camera view in real time.

The first one with the guy in the train station is fake for sure, unfortunately <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->. If you'll notice the image on the big screen doesn't always keep up with the bobbing/moving of the camera. Also, it's always in focus while other parts of the picture go out of focus.

Can't really tell with the other one.

The other one is legit, many news articles and the group actually got awarded $$ from some artfag association, cool huh?

Doesn't seem like it'd be too hard really. Most signs and shit are left on default configs for "simplicity", "who would want to hack a sign"? The ones that do video generally grab the content off a windows media server, or a vender specific stream server that's rather trivial to clone(and generally based off HTTP). Change the IP in the config to a friendly server, use J2ME app to stream webcam to server.... and you've got it all going <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

There's actually already a J2ME app to stream to a WMS server, but I don't know it's name and forget the link where I saw it.
