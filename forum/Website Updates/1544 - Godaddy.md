In the process of leaving Godaddy, if the site screws up, it's my fault  :o

If that turns out to be the case, I'll eventually fix it.

Word, would have liked to do it with everyone else, but yeah. And it transferred
over fairly seamlessly. Well, there was a lot of verification steps in between,
but there was no downtime. It actually maintained pointing at the correct
hosting.

But yeah, as of a few minutes ago, phx2600.org is now registered with NameCheap
instead  :D
