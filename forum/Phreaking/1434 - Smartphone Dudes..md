Why haven't any of you written a "manual war dialing" software for your personal
use? Or is that illegal, even doing number logging/increments? Press next >
[DISCO] [NIS] [PERSON] [FAX] [OTHER] > press next number + 1

I would've on my treo755p but it costs 100 bucks to get the resource editor for
onBoard C (which seems like the only way, its event driven completely...)  I've
looked around and haven't found any completely open source magic :(
