## Unplugging plugged me in.
Posted by **XlogicX** on Sun April 19th, 2009 11:05:02 PM

I’ve avoided most television for a while. I know there is a lot of debate on
whether television is good or bad, and arguments about it depends on what you
watch and how much. I really don’t care about those arguments; I’m mostly
looking at the results that I’ve experienced over a period of time.

For a while, I have that part of me in the back of my mind saying that I’m
cutting myself off from society by not watching television. The dominant
thoughts that I have may be unpopular, and the popular thoughts that all society
knows may be unknown to me. That kind of sounds bad.

Here’s why it’s not. Granted, I’m cutting myself off from ‘pop culture.’ I’m not
threatened by it because this pop culture is generated from television content
itself to begin with (because there is money to be made by influencing culture).
I’m cutting myself off from something fake, even if it is what everyone else
around me knows. By cutting myself off from that, I plug into authentic things,
even if they aren’t popular. I talk to other people that are also ‘cut-off.’ We
are part of an authentic culture, however small it may be, at-least it is real,
and our own.

I occasionally am in an environment where there is a television on, and
literally within minutes, I feel incredibly insulted by it’s manipulation. The
fact that many others are not is frightening to me. Not all television
programming is bad, but I have a computer, I can get it in other ways. Even if I
get it in ‘un-ethical’ ways…I don’t mind stealing from people like that. That is
not an argument for why it’s ethical, just why I don’t care about being less
ethical…’ethical.’

I’m interested in what other people think, I know I’m not the only one. Who
knows, maybe I’m overreacting (I don’t think so though).

I see your point, it seems valid to me.

I also live in a television-less environment, I think its been good for me, I
was sort of backwards though from what you were saying. I saw my parents and
others spending hours and hours a day in front of the TV when I was younger,
Trying to get them away from it was like pulling teeth and I just didn't want to
end up like that I suppose.

Seeing TV now, especially cable news usually just makes me laugh, the content is
so shallow, outdated, and useless that its like why even bother. Why is this
shit so important that its being broadcast to billions of people. Anyway that's
my take.

In a more tech related tangent, now that the analog airwaves are going away
there's a possibility that some of that bandwidth might open up for amateur use,
if so maybe things could be better.

*EDIT*

I decided to look for overt manipulation in the radio show I listen to this
morning on the way to work and I decided the most prevalent stuff is in the
advertisements with lines like "do what we did and chose at&t" etc. I'm sure
you're right though they get paid to say that and if they refuse they probably
wont have a job any more. Anyway just interesting.

Your statement about your parents watching too much TV reminds me of my
situation back in those days for me too. Later on before I moved out was when I
was transitioning from TV use to computer use. I remember getting grounded from
the computer merely because I was using the computer too much! I was actually
using the computer less then my dad was 'using' the TV. I find it hard to argue
how a computer is worse than TV, considering the interaction factor.

Oh, and I disputed (ignored) that grounding...for being groundless.

"Oh, and I disputed (ignored) that grounding...for being groundless."

Hell yeah, fight for your rights.

I'm sad no one else has replied to this thread, it seems like such a good topic.

this poor forum is getting less use than proper grammar at a rap concert lately.

Later.

Time to play the antagonist.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like
you're speaking primarily of News and other similar programming.  If that's the
case, I agree 100%, televised news sucks. Period. If that's not your argument,
I apologize.

I currently own a TV, but have no cable/satellite service to provide me with
television service.  However, I do find myself watching "television" shows
rather regularly via Hulu.com, ABC.com and through "other means."  After hearing
your points listed above, you may be prompted to ask why.  Allow me to explain.
At my previous job working for PetSmart, I did menial, mindless tasks for 8
hours a day.  All I wanted to do when I got home was do something to stimulate
my mind.  Now, in my new position as a web developer, I use my noggin all day
long and when I get home, I'm usually drained from a full day of work and all I
want to do is zone out for an hour or two, hence TV shows.

Another point in favor of TV, before I got married and was living with a friend
where we actually had TV and service, the majority of the programming I watched
came from two channels: The Discovery Channel and The History Channel, my
reasons, I could actually LEARN stuff while relaxing.

I guess my point here is, like anything else in this world, there's a good side
and a bad side to most everything.  The real judgement of how good or bad an
item is come in how you use it.

That seems pretty legit, I guess maybe I was just seeing it from the other side,
like its not how you use the TV its how the TV uses YOU. Soviet Russia excluded
it seems legit to also say that a good percentage of people are completely
unaware of the reality of the world outside their own locale, beside what
television feeds them day to day. This kind of reliance on any one media source
leaves people open to suggestion influence and in the end manipulation, sorta
like Logic said.

I think points are well made on both sides, but in the end this kind of sexual
contact simply isn't appropriate in a public school.

pip pip cheerio

tv like all media is how you use it

a computer or phone can be used just as mindless

most of the time

Good/Bad

Ying/Yang

Li/Qi

God/Satan

Love/Hate

Maybe we should take one step further, towards division or oneness?

One eternal moment? Or a series of memory and foresight experiences?

Do you see clearly, or darkly?

Forget it all, its all fake, even your real world.  Television is just the
shadow of your real world (school, work, sex, drugs, rock and roll), and the
shadows generated from your own mind generated out of it's own thought stuff.

There is eternal wisdom behind every symbol, infinite realities trimmed down to
this one...

BUT OF COURSE, the experience you are having is order arising out of chaos, our
brains, great quantum integrators and divisors, you are alone with yourself in a
sea of chaos resting in a beautiful bed of apophenia.

YOU'RE ALL DEAD!!! I hope you're grateful.

Even though Fightgar is probably trolling :), I would still argue that even if
reality is less real than perceived, television fantasies are still a
derived/2nd order reality to the one we perceive.

To PHLAKs statements about hulu and such, I'm most likely in more agreement than
anything. I still watch some shows (dexter, lost, southpark, etc...), I also get
them online (with no form of commercials). It is the medium (as it stands) of
television that bothers me. When it really comes down to it, commercials bother
me the most. And I completely understand their place; I know they are payment
for the operating costs to run television, I just don't care. I'm not going to
take my poison to lick a small honey stick, I'll just steal it from the poison
factory when I can. So indirectly, I do watch some television, I understand what
your saying about the need to turn you mind off now and then, we just avoid
going too far into the dark side.

Oh, and I do end up downloading the discovery channel and history channel
programming. I found an 80 Gb torrent for Modern Marvels a while back (score!).

in some cases the commercials are more enteraining than the shows

very much in the case of a lot of movie trailers being better than the full
length movie

Yeah, the commercials are certainly intended to be funny. I think those ones
bother me the most, it's not that they are not actually funny, it still comes
down to some subtle lines of manipulation. Jack in the Box commercials are
pretty funny (been a while since I've seen one though), but the food isn't, so
why is the commercial funny when their product isn't. It's not directly to
entertain you, but to get you to talk about it with other people...that's good
advertising, manufactured word of mouth.

I definitely don't want to give off the wrong idea though, advertising is not
bad. It can be used for a good. If a company really does have a great product
that is very competitive, it would be a shame for them not to sell their product
just because nobody knows about it (and it's benefits). What I have a problem
with, is any commercial that tries to sell me something without actually telling
me what is beneficial/competitive/good about the product, otherwise, I call
manipulation.

I'm not trolling, I'm just talking to myself

"In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there
"are few.

To become a beginner again allows one to see the infinite, not only in
possibility, but in the very form that our senses experience.

I am a dumbshit and everything I say are lies :twisted:

:shock:

SHHHHHHHHHHH, I'll be quiet with this silliness.

nah dude, it's cool. That quote is mostly a Zen Buddhist thing. Not that I'm
actually Buddhist, but I like the concept of the 'beginners mind' (shoshin). The
more grounded people get in their experience and opinions, the more closed they
get to new ones. Even Einstein got it right: "The only thing that interferes
with my learning is my education."
