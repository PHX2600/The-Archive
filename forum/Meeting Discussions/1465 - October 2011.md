Testing from Lola.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Urbal** on Fri October 7th, 2011 07:36:16 PM

Another test.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Urbal no longer needs to have every post approved each time, yay. I am going to make sure others don't have the same issue if I can help it.

Yeah, I noticed this too. I have a number of changes planned for this site, but just not finding the time to work on them.  I promise I'll get something out eventually.

In the mean time, I will keep an eye on the approvals and make sure they get pushed through smoothly and timely

Thanks.  I push them through when I see them, but sometimes that's a week or more after they've been published.

Yeah. For Urbal, had to just get him out of the 'new users' group, because even after his 3rd or 4th post after a month or so, it was still flagged as such.
