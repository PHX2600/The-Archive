## Cisco 2811 AC/IP Power Supplies
Posted by **dxh** on Sun March 1st, 2009 09:56:16 PM

A former employer was going to throw these away (they were literally in a waste bin), but let me keep them instead, since, seriously, freshly mis-ordered Cisco hardware in sealed boxes != trash.  Dumpster diving is a lot easier from the inside. <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

Cisco Part Number is: PWR-2811-AC-IP

I have a total of three.  Their condition is unknown, but they've been in a sealed cardboard box since I aquired them, so I figure they work.

Selling them for $30 each.  eBay is selling them for quite a bit more, so they'll likely sell fast.

But wait, what if there's no demand, unless of course for resell value on ebay, maybe craigslist would get you faster sales (I'm not even sure about that, that's a pretty specific item)

That might turn out to be the case.  The too-cheap-to-turn-down aspect of it might create a sort of artificial demand, though.

Commodities and toxic real estate assets in particular are currently having their prices artificially inflated above what they would otherwise sell for, being toxic assets and all.  I'm doing the opposite, actually.

Yeah definitely,

I didn't mean to imply anything, sorry if I did.

I like this new marketplace section.
