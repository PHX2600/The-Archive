I just bought this, and had to share. The Humble Indie Bundle #2. Here's the
pros:

-DRM Free
-Pay what you want
-Proceeds go to charity
-The EFF is one of the charities!
-Independent Games
-Available for Linux

Oh, and they're good games!

Already purchased this.  Fantastic deal, if only for Braid.  I donated $10 but
have paid more for less.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for some
entertainment.
