Big thanks to dhx for helping with os problems so now I got an os on my server. 
Next problem is I don't really know what to do with it. 
So if anyone here has any good ideas let me know I would like to open it up to people here to use also not great memory on it but will upgrade. Thanx

Web server?

I'm assuming you're running this in your home, so you're limited by your provider (probably Cox), so while you could do a web server, it wouldn't be easy, and any type of game server would not have the required bandwidth.

You might just want to make it a file/media server for you home.  That's something I've been wanting to do for a while.

Yeah, I don't know how I would live without the file server I set up. And you could still do a home web server for fun if you wanted to (I made a php intranet page that tells me what to eat at random when I can't decide). I also made it into a print server so it is retarded simple to print from any computer in the home.

i was thinking just a file server 
would like to do something where i could access files from anywhere with a connections maybe a vpn
was wondering if maybe there was a way i could set it up to terminal in and possible run programs across a vpn

Heh, I tried VPN, I couldn't get it to work, mostly because I'm a noobface though. I just got frustrated editing port forwarding (for many ports) on the router, configuring firewall, starting a bunch of services, and some etc...

This was all on a server 2003 box. Almost everything else was stupid easy, they pretty much have wizards for everything else (such as file and print serving), but I never got the VPN to work...user error. I will definitely never be a threat to hacking into your network.
