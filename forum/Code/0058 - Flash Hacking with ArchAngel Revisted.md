## Flash Hacking with ArchAngel: Revisted
Posted by **Valveritas** on Sat February 9th, 2008 02:23:33 AM

This thread refers a thread from the [http&#58;//www&#46;phx2600&#46;org/forum/viewtopic&#46;php?t=1443&amp;highlight=owned+flash](old board).

Having some time I finally got around to trying your short tutorial.  Yes, I realize it's like NINE MONTHS LATER.  Problem is (not surprisingly at this point), that 'owned' site is down.  So I had trouble completing the tutorial.  All I still have is the owned.swf, and I had used a slightly different method than you to retrieve it (if it even matters).

I'm wondering if you still have the files you posted on Rapidshare, and if it's possible to reconstruct this tutorial as it was originally.   I could beat myself for not downloading the files at that time.

I am confused by the part about &quot;index.mpl?p=gv&quot; but that may just be because I can't complete the tutorial.  

One lesson I've learned from this, is to do these right away and not lollygag around.

Hrmz, I don't think I saved the HashFlacking.zip file myself, actually - but I can tell you more about the index.mpl?p=gv bit:

.MPL files are actually just PERL files with HTML. I believe that EmbPerl (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://perl.apache.org/embperl/">http://perl.apache.org/embperl/</a><!-- m -->) uses them. We can assume that behind the scenes [http&#58;//vids&#46;myspace&#46;com/index&#46;cfm?fuseaction=vids&#46;individual&amp;videoID=802118363](in the server) there is some PERL code running that returns a value - in this case call it an authorization key - and dumps it plaintext to the page.

In the Flash side of things, their code calls the &quot;LoadVariables&quot; function - basically looking at the .mpl page and then loading whatever variables/value combinations it sees there into memory. So since the mpl file tells the flash to set &quot;fullName1&quot; to be equal to that long string of characters, it does so and the flash file continues executing. Without that authorization string generated by the server, the file just won't play - basically it doesn't think it has authorization to do so (even though in this case &quot;authorization&quot; is just a variable name being set).

But the hack is - the string is always the same, apparently. So if you create a dummy file with the same value from the website and rename it to .mpl - so long as it's in the same directory as the flash file, the flash file will think it's getting authorization.

Hope that helps - let me know if you want me to go more in-depth on something. ^_^

Sweet, I was able to complete this with the files I have. Thanks!  

If you want to do it yourself, here are the files you need:
<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mihd.net/es8kwz">http://mihd.net/es8kwz</a><!-- m -->

I compressed it with 7zip and put a password on it.  The 'password' should be obvious.   <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->   I just did this to be annoying, and to give you something else to do.  Remember, you still have to follow ArchAngel's tutorial to get the results.

After you've done the above, here's another challenge for someone: try and get this running on a website again.  My first attempt didn't work out.   Maybe the server has to support perl scripts and that's why.   <!-- s:? --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><!-- s:? -->

[http&#58;//members&#46;cox&#46;net/gorangutan/owned&#46;swf](Here it is).  Free hosting services weren't working for me for whatever reason.
