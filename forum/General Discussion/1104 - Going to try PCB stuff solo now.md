## Going to try PCB stuff solo now
Posted by **XlogicX** on Mon September 14th, 2009 08:45:56 AM

I got most of the materials. Some differences though, I got sodium persulphate for the copper etchant, I hope it's not worse or anything. I actually have to dilute this stuff in water, since I have it in power form right now.

I'm also attempting to make a dextrin solution. I'm baking the corn starch right now. I'm going to stir/re-flatten every 20 min or so, for hours.

The only thing I'm unsure about is the application on to the paper, I think penguin said he just paint brushed it on, I heard other people on the MAKE site talking about using a roller and such.

Either way, I may screw it up, but I guess it's better than not trying it, corn starch doesn't cost that much. It's the printer I'm worried about <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->.

yeah a roller or paintbrush will work just fine, just keep rolling/brushing until the coat is even and the glue starts to get tacky, then after that I let the paper dry for 5-15 minutes until I print on it, that's typically enough and i have never had any problems running it through the printer shouldn't be an issue.

all I can tell you is that the dextrin layer is pretty much the secret sauce, without that making the surface mount and really detailed stuff would be pretty dang tough.

also make sure you post pics of your beautiful boards when you're done!

Crap, I need more printer ink <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( -->. And I will probably get PCB from the same place you got yours, because my laminator got kind of pissed with the normal thickness. The cutout stuff is kind of cooler anyway though. So now it is the waiting game for stuff in the mail <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( -->. I think the dextrin turned out fine though, it's supposed to be kind of an orange powder right?

you're using a laser printer right? you said ink so just checking.

Yeah the dextrin is orange-brown-tan-ish, then you just boil that down in water. 

The cutout stuff is pretty cool, disadvantages are its only single sided and its so thin it bends easily. or maybe those are advantages idk.

sounds sweet dude, keep on truckin.

I'll have to check on the printer thing, becuase honestly, that could have been a problem. Good to know about the boiling too, heh. I just mixed it up in normal water, but boiling sounds like it would be much more effective.

The copper I got was one-sided anyway. With how thin the cut-out is, it's not like you can't just print a side on two pieces and put them together (if you line them up), I suspect.

Oh, I forgot to ask, what ratio of water to dextrin were you using? I was using something around 4 parts water, 1 dextrin. But this was just an arbitrary choice.

<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.radagast.org/~dplatt/hamradio/How_to_make_laser_toner_transfer_paper.pdf">http://www.radagast.org/~dplatt/hamradi ... _paper.pdf</a><!-- m -->

These instructions are pretty similar to what I did.

&quot;Now we must produce 16 Oz. of Dextrin glue. This is done by reducing a 10% Dextrin solution. 10% of 16 Oz. is equal to 1.6 Oz. (approximately 3 tablespoons which is 44 ml. metric) Place 3 tablespoons of Dextrin into your kitchen pot. Now we subtract 1.6 Oz. from 16 Oz. to get 14.4 Oz. (approximately 2 Cups.) Place 2 cups of water into our kitchen pot with the Dextrin. Stir the solution with our temperature and Teflon safe mixing spoon and bring to a boil stirring occasionally until most of the water has dissipated (in chemistry this is known as “reducing” a solution.)
The resultant product of this process should be 4 Oz. of Dextrin based glue. Store your product in your empty container and secure it with the lid.
Only yields 4 ounces? We have a 16 Oz. container. I see your point. 16 divided by four is four. So you can repeat the reduction process four times to produce 16 Oz. or multiply your 10% solution ingredients by four. Therefore use 8 cups of water to 12 tablespoons of Dextrin (which is approximately equal to 176 ml.) to produce 16 Oz. of Dextrin based glue. You should note that you will be placing 70 Oz. of 10% Dextrin solution into your pot at this point. 70 Oz. is equal to 2.2 quarts so you will need a 2.5 quart pot or larger to avoid spills from boiling the solution during reduction. In case you are wondering, 70 Oz. is approximately 2 liters. ?&quot;

*EDIT*

they say you need 16 ounces but so far i have made about 5-6 pages of the stuff and I have only used about an ounce or two so don't spend all night making the stuff like I did.

I got some lolz from all of the conversion math. I was waiting for the part where they took a dump truck (about 16 cubic yards) of dextrin and mixed it with a swimming pool of water (about 5,000 gallons).

Oh, and did you do the silicone coating as well? I think I'm under the understanding that it keeps the paper from warping.

yeah I used the sealant to keep it from warping, its such an easy thing to do you might as well.

So sodium persulfate is dumb, it took around 3-4 hours to eat the copper. I didn't make a very good board, but that's fine I guess, it was still functional, just not as close to 100% transfer as I would have liked. I think a lot of it had to do with the etchant chemicals, because the print on the copper looked pretty good after the paper came off. Even for my first try (from scratch), this was good enough for my purposes, but I would still like to get better.

Oh, I need to 'upgrade' my eagle software, the free version has some really irritating restrictions; I don't think it has the ability to autoroute either. Honestly, I did my first circuit in paint  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) --> , it functioned too. I just guess that's my style anyway though; back in the day with all that barcode stuff, paint was my app of choice.

I would like to get better with eagle though, I may try PCB123 as well. Eagle seems to have a weird learning curve. Not that there is a lot to learn, but some of it seems non-intuitive to me, after using multisim and software from alterea.

Holy Sh*t yeah that long in etchant is bound to have a poor effect on your etch resist ( the toner ),

maybe next time pick up some Ferric Chloride from &quot;The Shack&quot; or something, usually only takes about 15 minutes to do a complete etch, even if its cold.

I cant remember if I have the free version of eagle or not, I think its a student type version with restrictions on making commercial designs but it does auto-route and stuff. I thought I downloaded it from their site but maybe I torrented it I cant really remember.

Pics of the board you etched?
