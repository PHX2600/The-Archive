Ustream comes to mind... not sure it's entirely viable for this type of conference.  Also, Skype is top of the line and free for video conferences.  You might look into that.  Sorry I don't have any definitive answers.

Ok, so after much deliberation I have ruled out most services.

Here was the goal, Video conferencing with &quot;As good as&quot; or &quot;Better than&quot; Skype quality.

Challenge, Must go from 1 to 25 offices for company wide broadcast. They want, and I quote, a &quot;Talking Head&quot;. Pretty much in High def. They say bring me a solution.

SO I researchm Skype, 1 to 6, oovoo, 1 to 12. So Webex and Adobe and the other big 4, crappy vid quality and no fullscreen. Megameeting,  Major latency after a few minutes, Ustream, Ads.

So I present Telepresence and polycom and Accessgrid as the solution. They don't want to add hardware to the network. So this type of solution has been put out of the question by the Execs. Who want a solution but don't like the solution I bring them, this is IT's plight.

Ladies and gentlemen we have a Winner. After we ruled out free services, I found Livestream.com. Livestream is a lot like Ustream, but much more obnoxious on the ads. But what does livestream have, a private channel option. HD, 1.7 Mbps pipeline, password protected Broadcast. 1 to Many (over 25). The premium Service runs $350 a month or $3,500 a year.

I really didn't want to give them this solution considering we can setup a polycom or telepresence for close to the same price, but hey, what can an IT guy really do in the face of Executives.

We use RHUB web conferencing appliance in our organization in order to conduct webinars, web conferences, online meetings, video conferencing etc. It is easy to use and is only onetime payment as compared to monthly payments in hosted services.
