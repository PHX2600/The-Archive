[quote:2lozmer1]Solid state drives like most of Quantum's Rushmore series are, essentially, an X megabyte disk drive with an X megabyte RAM buffer, which prevents the disk having to serve any requests at all unless something's gone wrong.

The Rushmores use ordinary &quot;volatile&quot; RAM chips, pretty much like those used for plain system memory. If this RAM loses power, all of the data gets dropped on the floor.

So the drives have internal batteries.[/quote:2lozmer1]

It was called Compact Flash (CF-IDE). Funny!

If you are interested in USB internal expansions, check this vid, it is awesome. Little USBs outrunning SATA.

If you get through the first nine and 1/2 minutes, follow the video to part 2. It really gets cool.

Did't they start using this tech back in the day for allowing you to save your progress on old NES games like Final Fantasy and Legend of Zelda? Each cartridge had a battery inside to maintain the solid state memory.

we're just saying: don't forget to hold reset while turning the power off.  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->
