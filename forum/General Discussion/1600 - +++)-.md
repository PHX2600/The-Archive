I guess this is kind of late news, since hotmail had a pwnsy reset password setup since like the 6th of this month. They said they just patched it on the 21st. With the tamper-data plugin, you could inject the outgoing http request with +++)- and reset the password...magic.

Uh, so if you have hotmail/live/msn, just make sure your password is still **your** password.

Still happening I guess, different injection, same method. Not just hotmail either, but aol and yahoo mail as well...

what the glob.  That's interesting. Anyone have links (or just personal insight) to explaining the **why** behind the +++ exploit?
