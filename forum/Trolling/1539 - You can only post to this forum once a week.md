## You can only post to this forum once a week

What? That's outrageous!  What is the reasoning behind this rule?

It should be none at all, or at least be once a day.  No troll can be effective
with only one post a week.

That was kind of the point with Jargon...less effectiveness equaled good

Heh.  Well, my point would only be, he's already confined to one forum usually,
so it shouldn't matter as much.
