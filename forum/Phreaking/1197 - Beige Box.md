## Beige Box
Posted by **Medicine Storm** on Mon January 25th, 2010 11:00:32 AM

This is a special thanks to ArchAngel for saving our weekend.

A recent bout of bizzare Arizona weather knocked out our phone/DSL line on
Friday night. This weekend just happened to be when we planned a big WAN party.
D'OH! Called the DSL repairman, but he says they can't get to our house until
the roads reopen (Our secret lair is in some high-altitude secluded mountains,
so... lots of snow from the blizzard thing)

amidst our preparation for hari-kari, we remember the tiny beige box that
Archangel was handing out at a meeting long ago. We were able to go out to the
junction box and tap in and check our lines. the main line was dead, but the
security alarm line had a dial tone. We dialed the "down for maintainance" code
from the beige box (we used to work for a security company. Good times.) and ran
back to the house. After clipping the main line, we spliced the security panel
line in to the house. Bam! dial tone!

since both lines are under our name, they both get the DSL and both need a DSL
filter. After making a test call from the tiny headset that came with
ArchAngel's box, we were back in business and playing games like mad all
weekend. w00t! We know; it isn't really much of a hack, but it's not bad for a
phreaking noob.

Thanks for the box, ArchAngel!

Sounds like a pretty solid hack to me,

that's pretty good thinking taping into the other line like that.

Very nifty.  But knowing the down for maintenance code is what really makes this
work. Who knew that would come in handy?

Please send me that code or post it.   xD  I need to start a collection again.

It is different for each security company. I was paying attention when the tech
was setting it up, but it is usually a 4 digit code and the default is the last
four digits of the security company's phone number, or sometimes the company
address. (ie: 2600 East Fake drive, Phoenix AZ? try "2600")

Ah, very interesting. I did not know this.  Cool!
