## How to Make Lockpicks
Posted by **reteo** on Sun July 6th, 2008 11:01:40 AM

I was stumbling around thar intarweb when I came across an interesting video I
figured y'all would enjoy, if for the ability to have custom lockpicks without
the custom prices.

Not bad. I cant see the point in making picks unless that is what gives someone
joy. Feeler stock is a much better material for making picks, they will be more
durable and offer better feedback. I still cant justify making them when you can
buy professional full handled HPC picks at about $2 ea or less from a supplier.
The grinding will always weaken the metal compared to professional pick making
techniques such as stamping out picks, laser cutting, or water cutting. I have a
bunch of pick templates if anyone is into this stuff and wants to make a set.

NP, post some pictures if you have any prototypes. I have been wanting to make a
small pick set with PHX2600 engraved on the handles for a while. Something just
as a give away item. I haven't been able to find anyone that will make them for
a decent price.

That would be pretty sweet though, what kind of prices are you looking at?
