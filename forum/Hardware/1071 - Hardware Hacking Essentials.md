## Hardware Hacking Essentials
Posted by **dxh** on Tue August 18th, 2009 08:48:53 PM

Dear 2600,

I am going to start various hardware hacking projects, one of the first being a
peggy board.  I have a 25 watt soldering iron, a small two-clamp magnifying
glass thingy, a desk lamp, and an oscilloscope made by a DeVry student from the
40s, which I'm told isn't terribly reliable, but looks like something from WWII,
so I have it.

What else do I need?  I plan on doing some IEEE 802.14 (Zigbee) projects in the
future too...

soldering iron is a bit under powered dont think it will heat pad at 25 W

shouldnt need and oscope for a peggy board

a good digital multi meter is a must

screw driver set (both jewler and regular style)

google is good for finding pin outs

graphing calculator

thats all you should need for starting out on some kits

good sets sold here also

What wattage would you recommend for Peggy making, and whats the graphic
calculator for?

At Toorcamp, Bre Pettis had this cool hand-held oscilloscope that he made from
some kit.  I forgot what its called but he said the kit costed like $30 or $40,
don't remember the name of it, but that seems a lot lower than a typical
O-scope.  Any idea what it was?

he may have had this

a variable watt soldering iron is the best buy

the 25W will work just have to use a different technique  to get a good fillet

the calculator is for doing electronic math ie figuring out volt drop,total
resistance ,rms value etc

Yup, that's the one!  Cool sig, btw. :)

I have a 25W and its plenty hot for my tiny pcb projects (too hot I feel at
times...) anything above 25 is going to be for some heavier duty stuff IMHO...

I had crappy irons all my life until I got a weller... it gets annoying working
with bad irons, as terrordrone said the adjustable ones are really neat, but
cost ~$100+ (I've only got to use one a few times)

The O-scope will be good for just checking to see if signal is there, if it
hasn't been calibrated in years I wouldn't try measuring digital clock signals
or anything ;), is your o-scope a heath kit by any chance? I've used zelscope as
a soundcard o-scope, works pretty good.

I wish I had a variable benchtop power supply, but nope :(

A good project might be converting a computer power supply to a benchtop +/- 5,
12 volts...

Breadboard (and protoboard), breadboard jumper wire, 30awg kynar wire (good for
circuit bending, modding pre-existing pcbs.. just tiny insulated wire), stranded
~26awg wire (a couple colors would be nice, but all I have is yellow!)... an
organizer to place parts and.... one of these to start getting your place messy:

I have instructions laying around somehwere for a home brew function generator
and varible power supply I can prolly dig them out and pass them on

Peggy boards are great starter projects blinkng leds are the "hello world" of
hardware
