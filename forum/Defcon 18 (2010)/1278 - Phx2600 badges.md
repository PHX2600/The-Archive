## Phx2600 badges
Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Sat July 31st, 2010 05:04:39 PM

Its that time of year again where we all get to see the totally sweet work of
Joe Grand and his electronics infused Defcon Badges.

I am interested in producing badges for our group at some point but I also don't
want to put myself in the poor house doing it.

So my question is, what would it be worth?

Assuming that the badge had some kind of visual display or output and some kind
of wireless functionality what would you be willing to pay for an EXCLUSIVE
PHX2600 badge.

I'd probably pay between $20 and $30 for a badge.  If they were really awesome,
maybe up to $50.

badges i think it would be a great project and we have the skills

I would also be interested in helping with the design/building, however my
skills in this area are lacking, but I'll do what I can.

Cool,

Lets start brainstorming ideas for what we would want such a device to be
capable of then and I can start doing some feasibility studies.
