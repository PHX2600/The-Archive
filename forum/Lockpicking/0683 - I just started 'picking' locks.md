## I just started 'picking' locks
Posted by **XlogicX** on Sun November 30th, 2008 03:03:46 AM

Yeah, up to this point, I have only really raked/rocked locks open, leaving it to luck for the most  part. I eventually did get slightly skilled at rocking a lock open, but it is still very unpredictable.

I have since switched from my favorite snake pick to try using the half-diamond pick. I had better success with it on my pad locks then with rocking (when I am focusing).

The other day, my friend challenged my to open his front door dead-bolt. I had never opened a house door, I have tried, but never succeeded. This time though, I had it turned in less than a minute. The door did not open though, and I took the picks out in defeat. I then rationalized that I just didn't turn it far enough (this is true). I tried for another 5 minutes to open the door with no success and then gave up.

As most lock picking goes, I had to go back for more. I got it open in around 1-2 minutes this time, and turned it all of the way. I opened the door. yay. The downside, we couldn't get the lock back to it's normal state, even with the key, the pins were all stuck.

I opened the lock and the back 3 springs and pins came out, the first 2 springs wouldn't come out even with a good pull. I'm not too sure what I did to it. I was wondering if anyone had any good theories on it (@thatguy). The only thing that I can think of was that I pushed the top part of the pin at an angle into the spring wedging it.

LOL, nice. What you did was turn the lock too far and the top pins and spring have fallen into the bottom of the plug. To prevent this you need to stick your pick into the bottom of the plug flat to keep the top pins from falling into the bottom of the plug as you rotate it around. Not a real big deal you will need to take the lock completely apart and re-pin it. If the lock still works you are probably just missing a few pins so instead of 5 pins it probably just has a few missing. It would probably take me about 3 pages to write a how to, plus you need a few  unique tools, plug follower,  pin kit, shim, to do it successfully. If you cant get the KIK (Key in Knob) cylinder out of the knob or lever there is a thin strip of brass covering the top pins of the bible. You can slide it off with a pair of needle nose pliers and remove the messed up springs from the top. If the lock is rim cylinder i.e. used in deadbolts. You will just have to remove the plug and dig out the compressed springs from inside of the cylinder housing.

even if he made it up it does sound pretty good enough big words and trade lingo to make novice guys feel like novices
