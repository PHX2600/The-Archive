## Save our Site Contest Voting
Posted by **PHLAK** on Wed September 8th, 2010 01:35:40 PM

Okay! I finally got around to it and here's the poll.  Please vote accordingly.

**[u:3affrqt7]Rules[/u:3affrqt7]**
This poll will run for 14 days from posting (should end on the 22nd). One vote per person. You can change your vote at any time but they will lock in at the end of the poll.  The article with the highest number of votes at the end of the poll will be the winner.  Any form of automated voting will invalidate those votes.

I shouldn't have to mention this but if I see a large number of new accounts being registered and voting (especially if they're using throw away email addresses) I will ban those accounts and invalidate their votes.  If you are new(ish) and/or this is your first post, make mention to that below so I know that your aren't a bot/vote-spammer.

That would be us. We think it is not only an awesome toy, but also a feasable project. We already posess most of the materials required. Also, our secret mountain lair is so remote that we would not be violating any noise polution ordinances, despite the article's disclaimer.
