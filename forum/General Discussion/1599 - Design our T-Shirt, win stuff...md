What’s in store for the winner? Besides having their awesome design plastered all over creation, and having Urbal say “the t-shirt doesn’t suck”, a few prizes will be presented to them at Defcon 20. This includes a few special SEORG t-shirts sporting YOUR winning design and a nice swag bag filled with goodies like a numbered and limited edition SE Challenge coin, a copy of Chris’ book and a special surprise we can’t tell you yet.

We also plan on transferring the design into a special SEORG wallpaper which will be displayed and can be downloaded from the SEORG website. Not enough? How about a warm introduction at this year’s SE CTF  and all the credit you could want? We thought so
