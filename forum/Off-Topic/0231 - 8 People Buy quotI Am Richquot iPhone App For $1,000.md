Yeah, I found this article from google news. These 8 people fail. A quick summary is that the App is just a screensaver that doesn't really do much. What is worse is that those 8 people may have already known that, they just had the money.

From what i gather these people knew it didn't do anything but its kinda like a bling-bling  badge for them to wear. Really sad honestly that people feel money makes them important instead of just shallow.

Since the app was pulled, do you suppose the creator will get the money from the sales?
