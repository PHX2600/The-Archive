## 2600net #PHX2600 fail status
Posted by **jargon** on Mon December 7th, 2009 01:12:19 PM

Please send private messages to r0d3nt on the 2600net IRC network asking him why
no forum members of <http://phx2600.org/> have founder access to #phx2600
despite under Emmanuel's own rules about channel naming guidelines that #phx2600
is a private channel.

Emmanuel's official guidelines state that official 2600net 2600 Hacker's
Quarterly monthly meet-up IRC channels must have 2600 with the two letter
country code following and the two letter province/state code leading, with the
exception of states in the United States not requiring the trailing country
code, with the exception that the main 2600 channel has no prefix or suffix, and
that any other IRC channels on 2600net containing the text "2600" in the channel
name be privately operated channels on 2600net.

My suggestion to allot 3 letter or 4 letter international airport codes in front
of 2600 as an official channel was never ratified by Emmanuel despite putting it
on the table every year since 2004.

Obviously, the man wants it to be a fucking private channel.

So why does r0d3nt claim the channel is to be owned and operated by Emmanuel
despite Emmanuel strictly claiming it to be a privately owned and operated
channel on 2600net?

r0d3nt's story is that I have simply been sitting on #phx2600 meaning he claims
I gave been squatting on it meaning he is claiming I have been keeping it to
myself without doing any proper upkeep and meaning he claims I haven't been
opping anyone else on the channel.

I have been granting ops on a regular basis of the few who enter, keep the topic
up to date of current events, even so much as putting a warm greeting and
simplified true-to-spirit of PHX2600 guidelines along with a channel description
matching current events.

It took me 3 weeks to come up with a formula for #phx2600 topics on 2600net that
always fits, yet always has all the important info:

short description of group, website of group, time/date of next meet-up, address
of meet-up, description of adjacent building.

Since a topic only fits a max of 160 symbols on 2600net, you can see why this
took 3 weeks for me to come up with a formula that works every time.

Here is the formula as follows:

  * {spc} is a space.
  * Text in <> is part of the madlib.
  * / is a madlib option separator.

There are no line breaks nor carriage returns in the topic, they are just
presented here for readability's sake.

    Humble Central Arizona Lamers
    {spc} | {spc}
    <site url>
    {spc} | {spc}
    Meet-Up:
    {spc}
    <month name> {spc} <day of month> <st/nd/rd/th> {spc} <hour> <am/pm>
    {spc}
    @
    {spc}
    <shop name>
    {spc}
    (
    <building number> {spc} <N/S/E/W> {spc} <street name>
    {spc}
    just {spc} <north/south/east/west> {spc} of {spc} <adjacent shop>
    )

(This is an average range of 140 to 160 exact characters.)

Best channel join greeting that fits:

So, despite Keal's jibberish and trolling and abuse of 2600net and it's users..

Anyone is welcome to use any channel they want. However, if a 2600 channel is
being used to cybersquat on the channel, troll it's users,  I've received many
complaints from phoenix users as well as general 2600net users, I'm forced to
take control of it.

Generally all of #XX2600 #2600XX channels are founded by Emmanuel, this is
purely symbolic, and if users contact me to assign ops or request help, if they
are up to the task, I'll assign a SOP " super op ". Keal requested this, but no,
I'm not interested in giving him control over any channel that represents 2600
in any shape or fashion. If another user from the area would like to help
maintain that channel, feel free to contact me.

Keal's misunderstanding about how 2600net works and how the ircd and services
work, I can't help him. I've dealt with him and his jibberish for years now. I'm
not the only administrator of 2600net who feels this way.

Feel free to message me on irc.2600.net if you have any questions.

After a couple years of dealing with Keal, I am quick to tell him no, and quick
to ban him. Patience of the users and the network runs out pretty quickly.
Usually I only deal with him when I get complaints.

He's a waste of time, skin, breath, and text. Sorry Keal. Stay on your meds pal,
and I wish you the best.

Sincerely,

r0d3nt

r0d3nt doesn't know what the fuck he is talking about nor how 2600net works.

I used a 2600net IRC network backdoor to update the channel description, topic,
URL, access list, etc.

Channel descriptive information:

> **#phx2600 Topic** A channel for Humble Central Arizona Lamers |
> http://phx2600.org | Meet-Up: January 1st 6pm @ Unlimited Coffee (741 E
> Glendale Ave just east of Juliobertos)

> **#phx2600 Description** PHX2600: Phoenix / Sky Harbor / Maricopa 2600 - Refer
> to our site: http://phx2600.org/ as run by PHLAK and XlogicX. Please leave
> your ego at the door.

> **#phx2600 Entry Message** All hacking is, is augmenting something from its
> as-is condition into a different condition so it may be put to use in an
> alternate scenario, like how a lumberjack turns a tree into lumber for a
> house, thus 'hacking'. It isn't about what one knows or doesn't know, it is
> about one's dedication and merit of their efforts.

Channel history information:

> **#phx2600 Registration Date** Jul 25 19:01:04 2008 PDT

> **#phx2600 Last Used Date** Dec 09 00:35:16 2009 PST

> **#phx2600 Last Topic** A channel for Humble Central Arizona Lamers |
> http://phx2600.org | Meet-Up: January 1st 6pm @ Unlimited Coffee (741 E
> Glendale Ave just east of Juliobertos)

Channel contact information:

> **#phx2600 URL** <http://phx2600.org/>

> **#phx2600 Founder** emmanuel

> **#phx2600 Email** emmanuel at 2600 dot com

Channel access information:

> **#phx2600 Super Ops** Keal, VK

> **#phx2600 Ops** handler, MrResist0r

> **#phx2600 Half Ops** box2

> **#phx2600 Voices** (none)

If you want on the channel access list, please come to
<irc://djslocker.2600.net/phx2600> (or any other hub/server of 2600net, and
register your screen name along with sending a private message or memoserv
message to Keal via the 2600net IRC network or a private message via this forum
to jargon requesting being added to the access list.

Which of SOP/OP/HOP/VOP status will be assigned depends on your past history on
IRC in general, the <http://phx2600.org/> forums, various PBXs  &  other party
lines, various hackerspaces, and attendance and quality of behavior at the
various conferences  &  DEFCON / 2600 meet-ups especially the phx2600 meet-ups.

plain & simple: If you are a dick your access list rank will be lower, you do
not have to be a phx2600 forum member or phx2600 meet-up attendee to gain
#phx2600 access list status so long as you help out, contribute, or are
otherwise friendly.

Hints: Kilo will be a SOP once he regs his screen name.

XlogicX and PHLAK will become AOP if they ever reg and use the IRC, (Just AOP
due to not wanting to create a phx2600 monopoly due to monopolies not being in
the best interests of the group; the "r0d3nt" post above is a prime example why
monopolies in the 2600 community in general are a bad idea!)

Happy hacking & hope to see you on the IRC! :lol:

btw:
<http://phx2600.retromachineshop.com/?Section=Hours&Hours=Unlimited%20Coffee>

Notice that Unlimited Coffee was open from 6am to 6pm on December 31st 2008, and
open from 6am to 2pm January 1st 2009.

We may may have to either reschedule the hours of the January 1st 2010 PHX2600
meet-up, or else change the location for just January 1st 2010.

I still have to verify with THE BEST BARISTA IN THE WORLD what the actual
Unlimited Coffee open hours will be New Years Day 2010.

There are only five days of the year that Unlimited Coffee has shorter hours:
Independence Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years Eve, New Years Day.
Normally, Unlimited Coffee is open 6am to midnight every day.

Cheers!
