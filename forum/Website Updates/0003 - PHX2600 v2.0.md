## PHX2600 v2.0
Posted by **PHLAK** on Tue December 25th, 2007 12:46:14 PM

MERRY CHRISTMAS PHX2600!

Welcome to the brand new PHX2600 website! I have been hard at work the past week and a half or so to bring you this fresh new site. This site has been tested rigorusly durring the design phase, but like any human being, I am suceptible to making mistakes. If you notice any spelling, design, or other flaws with this site, or would like to contact me, please do so [url=http&#58;//www&#46;phlaknet&#46;com/contact&#46;php:225ja69c]here[/url:225ja69c].

Along with this site comes an update to our forums as well. With the update to PHPBB v3.0, we should see some performance increase and spambot decrease (at least for now). Unfortunately, to save time and effort, we have decided to go with a brand new install of v3.0 rather than migrate the old board. This will require you to re-register, so do so as soon as possible. If, for some reason you don't get your old name back, please contact an administrator to have this issure resolved. Also, we will be keeping the old forums up and locked for archival purposes. To view the old forums, please go to [url:225ja69c]http&#58;//www&#46;phx2600&#46;org/forum[/url:225ja69c].

Thanks go out to XlogicX for all the help in this move and to all of you for your support and participation in PHX2600 over the years!

That's kind of what I was going for.

I know you can migrate the messages from the old board over. Probably the users too. It's all just mysql, innit?

Hook dat shit up. Let me know if you need any help.

I know it's possible, we chose not to. There were already some problems migrating from one version of 2.0 to the next version within 2.0, several of the tables in the mysql database would through errors. I had to change small pieces of the code to get it to go over. Eventually, I ended up with a mixed version of many php 2.0's. I wasn't looking forward to the ugly picture that would have for going from 2.0 to 3.0, although I personally still wanted to do it. I held a quick poll on the old board for what people wanted to do, the choice (to my surprise) was to go from scratch. This includes to opinions of users like PHLAK and Evil1, some more heavily involved users.

Although, I did leave the old board up for reference, so not all is lost.

Like XlogicX said, yes, it is possible to move all the old stuff over, and yes, it is just MySQL.  However, we have decided not to for a few reasons.  1) It's just less work on our end.  2) Last time XlogicX did some board work, he had trouble with the MySQL tables, and, more or less, had to Macgyver them (paper clip, bubble gum, and tobacco pipe style) to get them to work.  3) Speed issues (take note that the old board is slow in comparison).  4) Technical difficulty's (I have witnessed my share). And 5) out of the 179 registered users we have on the old boards, only 46 of them have posts in the double digits (that's 10 or more), and only half of those are above 50.  This way we can tell who still participates more easily and not have to worry about cleanup of all the old stuff.

This is why we can't have nice things.

Found a much better way to do the forums.  Got it to work a lot better.  Let me know if you find any problems with it.

Well the phpbb3.0 is definitely a great improvement to what it use to be. Even enough to consider using it for my own sites. The boards are finally properly coded and compliant!!!  The nice clean feel it gives to the eye is WAY better.

LOLWUT?!  I don't know what you're asking.

Posted by **Medicine Storm** on Mon January 7th, 2008 09:53:30 PM

Ah. so that's why we couldn't add you as a foe. freakin' admins! As for the Penal forum, PM XlogicX just to make sure we're not stepping on some toes.

I don't care that much... if you guys talk behind my back... oh well.

Posted by **Medicine Storm** on Wed January 9th, 2008 10:05:46 AM

We love the look and feel. Would you be willing to show us the code? It is a great template. If not show us, would you sell us the code?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **XlogicX** on Wed January 9th, 2008 02:00:22 PM

Phlak, the only talking behind your back I have done is about how good of a job you have done.

Talking behind peoples back is not really my style, it usually gets back to you anyway. If your going to be an asshole, it is best done in public.

LOL.

This is getting fun. If you get to quote us then we will quote us, too. 

(We believe this is the message that PHLAK intended to quote, but we could be wrong)

It looks neat but I will have to get used to seeing everyone's name underneath the post title. A couple of times I've been scanning looking for it not realizing that yeah it's underneath. I sort of do avatar recognition anyway though.

This site is looking so great, I couldn't resist registering.  I use to go by --- btw.

It's definitely an attractive new layout, and the colors are nowhere near as jarring.  One thing, though; I like to keep my windows as windows, at 800x600 resolution, and this layout has the annoying tendancy to require fullscreening just to see the page properly.  Any chance that a reduced-size board style can be added to the options?  I hate fullscreen anything if I can avoid it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **PHLAK** on Fri March 7th, 2008 12:45:08 AM

I understand where you're coming from Reteo.  I keep most of my windows windowed too, however, a skinnier version of this site will not be coming.

Now for the reasons:

1) For starters, in todays lineup of technology, a screen resolution of 1024x768 (the width I accommodated the site for) is standard, if not small.
2) If you take a look at some of the statistics I've gathered here: [url:kp3ze2mg]http&#58;//farm3&#46;static&#46;flickr&#46;com/2070/2261668406_2fd17f1e32_o&#46;jpg[/url:kp3ze2mg], the smallest screen resolution this site has seen is 1024x600, a reasonable width for viewing this site, though screen must be maximized.
3) This is the first site I've done assuming a 1024 screen width, everything prior has accommodated an 800 pixel width, and when I did those, I often times got comments that the sites seemed empty, and I should fill out the browser more.  So, I decided on trying something larger.
4) We're hackers, shouldn't we all have the biggest baddest hardware around?!  I mean, I don't even use a monitor anymore, I browse the internet through the Gibson!
5) And lastly, I just don't feel like working that hard.  The work I'd have to put forth to accommodate a screen resolution that is hardly, if ever used any more is just not worth it.
6) ???
7) PROFIT!

Well there ya have it, but thanks for the compliments, I'm glad people are enjoying the new look.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Valveritas** on Fri March 7th, 2008 07:00:34 AM

Yeah, I was going to say, 1024x768 is industry standard nowadays.
