Back in 2003 or 2004 there was only 5 hours left in a ValleyMetro public arts
tagging contest running 4 weeks. The dude finally tracked me down in the school
cafe after looking for me at Art Institute of Phoenix via word of mouth. He
explained the contest and told me I could hand in my entry by the end of the day
and that it was the last day of the contest. I said "Fuck that, check this.",
pulled out a 72" sheet of paper, got out my Magnums and drew that shit up in
under two minutes as my entry. I noted to him that I "used an x-acto" for the
second half of the slogan because I "felt like being lazy". His response was,
"Damn...... I think you just won."

I pulled the entire billboard design out of my ass on the spot, even the "no
taggin our wagon" slogan.

The yellow ink is brickwork, while the green ink is bubbly sewage. Enjoy! (As
photographed yesterday from inside the 106E city bus reversing route to become
the 106W at the Paradise Valley Mall station using a Katana II cellphone.)
