## There isn't any introduction section
Posted by **GTKlondike** on Wed June 22nd, 2011 08:26:20 PM

Hey all, 
Looking around your site, I haven't seen any introduction section so I decided to make my own. I'm GTKlondike, 22 yr old network consultant. I'm an avid computer and security enthusiast but mostly focused on the networking route/switch side. 

I've actually been looking into the PHX2600 chapter since I first heard about it at DC17, however, I wanted to attend a meeting before I actually joined the site. Unfortunately, with the current project I'm on, it doesn't look like I'll be able to attend for many many months. So with that, I decided to join anyways and see what I can do to contribute to the site in the mean time.

I will be at Defcon this year, so if anyone wants to meet there in RL, let me know.

Hi  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D --> 

I was looking for an intro section too.  I'm 23, want to learn more about information security and random obscure stuff, meet people, make friends, drink coffee. I'm going to try and make it to the next meeting on 9/2.

Cool! Hello and welcome, maybe you folks can breathe some life into this board <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->
It's been quite slow and I just check up on it every once in a while.
Any special projects (that you haven't signed a NDA for...) that you are currently working on?  Any particular interests?

@Klondike: What aspect of route/switch security are you into, cisco acls? arp, icmp, ip(v4/6) vulns?  How did you become a security consultant? You some sort of gypsy charlatan or do you know your stuff? <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

@Tokyo: Cool, will hopefully be pleased to meet you IRL <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> seem pretty cool on the internet <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->
