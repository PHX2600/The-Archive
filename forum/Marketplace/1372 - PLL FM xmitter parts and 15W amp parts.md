## PLL FM xmitter parts and 15W amp parts?

Maybe someone can figure out what I did wrong? I paid a lot for the kit a few
years back when I wanted to do the vegas defcon pirate radio... couldn't put it
together, and lost interest since I really had no desire to run a arggggh radio
station in phx town. If anyone wants to try and fix it or know someone who would
like to I have the stuff. If not, I may even ship it back to the dude in
Berkeley, CA (its from the guy who runs free radio Berkeley)

This will be a team effort for sure.

I dont know that much about standard FM implementation and I have never played
with PLL outside of config registers.

So whenever me and NaK start working on it I'll make sure I let you know.

By our powers combined. CAPITAN PLL FM XMITER.

this would be a great primer
