## Wireless AP with &quot;guest&quot; mode
Posted by **Rax** on Mon February 22nd, 2010 07:54:08 PM

Does anyone know of a wireless AP (aside from the Cisco Aeronet line) that has a &quot;guest&quot; mode? Basically, looking to set up 2 WLANS in a client office. 1 for employees, 1 for people who come to their office. Guest mode should only have access to the Internet.

There's &quot;rumors&quot; of these all over the place, but I can't find a search term.

Thanx

Found a solution. dd-WRT supports it. In fact, there's a ton of neat stuff in there.

If you're interested.

I had a Siemens Speedstream HomePlug/802.11b router that supported that but they stopped making them years ago <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( -->

Good catch on DD-WRT though

I thought I saw that feature in a custom firmware somewhere, but when I checked my Tomato install I didn't see it.  Thanks for the info though, I may have a friend that could use this.
