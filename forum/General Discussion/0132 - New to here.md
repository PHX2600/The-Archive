Howdy and welcome!
The meetings are very loose and are just a time and place pretty much, sometimes there are presentations other times it's just a chill out.  Not much else to know, just have fun!

Do you have any particular interests or things you wish to learn from this group? I'd say this is a very diverse and friendly 2600!

I grew up mainly in the SF bay area 
but moved here from North Carolina 
My main interest in what I refer to as "junkyard engineering" 
just taking old stuff and compnents and making something new.

"junkyard engineering," I've never heard that term before, but it sounds like a familiar concept <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->, we can probably share stories.

Hey there and welcome! A few years back I remember reading about people making things like tesla coils out of junk. I bet I'm not the only one who would like to see a presentation of stuff you've put together out of junk.

Hey everybody. I'm HalfSight. I look forward to the meeting. I'm not so much a hacker as I am a wares trader. I like software and trying to manipulate my OS installs as much as possible. I prefer Ubuntu right now but I am trying out other distros as I gain more knowledge of linux. I do like windows though, I have to be honest. I like the x64 Vista, but thats it these days. I have stacks of OS installs and I try to have as many slipstreams as possible for fun.

Welcome to the PHX2600 HalfSight.

[quote="HalfSight":2gg1tpnq]I have stacks of OS installs and I try to have as many slipstreams as possible for fun.[/url][/quote:2gg1tpnq]

What do you like to slipstream?  I've only slipstreamed a Windows disc once, and that was to get some RAID drivers onto it cuz I didn't have a floppy drive.  But yeah... what else is good to slipstream onto the install disc?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **HalfSight** on Thu July 31st, 2008 06:24:47 PM

I don't so much do some of the slipstreaming myself, But I collect ones that I find. I have done it once for my old P4 so it would automatically install my drivers for my hardware. But I am about to install a Slim xp slipstream on my sisters computer so she can try it out. So Its basically  Windows XP with a lot of the B.S. services turned off for Higher performance. I think the program you can use is called nLite. You can download it here: <http://www.nliteos.com/>. It's for editing ISO's. I got a buddy that knows more, but I was thinking of making my own. I have a windows live CD too. It comes in handy.

Yeah, nLite is what I used.  Seemed like a very powerful tool, though I just used it for drivers, and it didn't look too difficult to navigate as well.

Howdy and welcome (I'm from Texas).
More than welcome to come hang out at meetings, I'll be the guy with the box of network cable crimping new ends. When you get in come on over and shake my hand, backyard engineering sounds awesome.
