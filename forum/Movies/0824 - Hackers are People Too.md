## Hackers are People Too
Posted by **nytebrew** on Tue June 9th, 2009 08:39:05 AM

I searched the video on demand section of amazon.com for hackers, i wanted to download that movie from the mid-90's with the crazy screens of teh gibson and all that. Anyway, the first result is something called &quot;Hacker's are People Too&quot;. So I bought it and started streaming it, and it appears be a compilation of interviews from Defcon 2007 (15?). I thought I saw Rhy0t in it, which I wasn't expecting, and then in her second appearance you see her handle rendered by the character generator. Also, somebody said they got a uController from LoST. Anyway, check it out, i'm having trouble directly linking to it, but i can link to the search. Maybe I can bring the video to the next meeting if anyone is interest, but it's not much money if you want to check it out.

I downloaded the movie off the internet torrent and then I watched it over the xbox streaming thing and I was like &quot;Man these hackers really think they are the shit&quot;  So then I watched it all the way through and it was just like an ego booster and I was all like feeling good and badass n smart n stuff, but then I stubbed my toe and the toenail died and fell off only half way <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( -->
