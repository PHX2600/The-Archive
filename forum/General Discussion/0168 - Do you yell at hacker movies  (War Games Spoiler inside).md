## Do you yell at hacker movies?  (War Games Spoiler inside)
Posted by **alienkid** on Sun August 3rd, 2008 12:08:47 PM

I just got trolled by a movie.  I was watching War Games, and it was at the end where he asked how he could get the computer to play tic tac toe by itself.   Falkner or said to enter "Zero", so l33t hax0r typed in Zero and just sat there staring lovingly into Falkner's eyes with the computer counting down before it started ending the world.
So I Yelled "Press the damn enter key!"

Has a movie made you yell at it?

Yes.  The scene in Swordfish where the worm is being made with cubes.  Everyone hacker knows octagons are the correct worm shape.  DURRR, Hollywood!

UGH!  Untraceable made me yell like 20 times.  First off, they tried to make this movie "technical" by jamming every fucking technical word they could into each sentence.  This movie is riddled from start to end with computer terminology, so much they even used the term "e-vite" (as in electronic invitation).  Seriously, who uses the word e-vite?

Anyway, they did a pretty good job (for the most part) in using these technical terms correctly, but EVERYTHING they actually performed on the computer was totally fake.  One of my favorite things was how the main character, a governmentally employed computer security expert, had her home computer hacked by a simple backdoor/trojan  that installed itself alongside a children's game.

Anyway, if I think about this movie any more, I'm going to explode.  If you're in for a laugh at an utter lack of technical detail, please, watch Untraceable.

I encourage all of you to watch the "Fuzzy Logic" episode of La Femme Nikita, one of my favorite episodes.  Not because it has a lot of errors, but because it manages to be - though still fantastic - a fairly accurate depiction of code cracking, computers, and the arrogance sometimes associated with hacking.   It's by no means perfect, but it's quite entertaining, and really gets me in the mood to try and do something similar. 

You might want to download a torrent instead, but you can view the [http://us.video.aol.com/player/launcher?ar=us_en_video_748x541_full&amp;mode=1&amp;pmmsid=1458176](episode here).

The web video is kind of buggy for me.  I can't run it in full screen, and if I pause or fast forward it locks up.  Also, doesn't work in Firefox for me and there's quite a few annoying ads. <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

So try and find something better if you can.  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

No. I **like** it when the text on the monitor is also clearly readable, but backwards, on the actor's forehead as he crouches over the screen.
