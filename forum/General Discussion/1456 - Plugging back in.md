## Plugging back in
Posted by **ArchAngel** on Wed September 14th, 2011 08:26:44 AM

After disappearing for *forever*, I thought I'd check up on the PHX2600 forums ... especially since I think I was supposed to be modding the UE/SE/CJ forums. ^_^;; 

But yar, just a quix note to say that I'm back -- I've been hacking my way around the country for the last couple of years, working my way from the literal North Pole to wherever the wind took me (currently on the East Coast), and largely without special equipment like cell fones or laptops. Lessons learned on that topic some other time, though.

Sincerest shoutz to dual, rax, zapperlink, xLogicx, medicine, phlak, evil1 -- and for that matter, anyone else from the original crew who might still be hanging around. Will plan on hanging out here or wherever it is you leet mo-fos chill more frequently, and with a little lux will see you dudes in the PHX meatspace in a couple of months. *grinz*

Totally have not forgot about you dude, glad to hear your plugging back in...I have recently made the same decision. I've remained social I guess, but haven't really been &quot;plugged in&quot; for years, I miss it. I miss the old BinRev community and what it stood for, I miss Radio Freak America, I miss actually reading 2600 and listening to Off the Hook (despite all the needless complaining on the show), lol. I've read the last couple issues though. Not sure what happened, but a lot of us seemed to all drop out around the same time, or so it seems. Maybe that's just my perception since I've been somewhat unplugged.

Thanks for the greetz everyone; it means a lot. ^_^!

XLogic -- totally agree about everyone seeming to unplug at the same time. O_o! Weirdly, the PLA seems to be pretty active still, but a lot of the binrev projects seem to have died from inactivity. I PM-ed Stankdawg actually, and he replied (edited, since it wasn't a public post and I'm not sure how much he wants re-posted):
[quote:3f977ln7]I am pretty much retired from the scene and the server is run by others (Truncated) ... for the most part I ended everything that I couldn't do by myself anymore because no one ever helps. Projects either died and I let the domains expire or they live under someone else's direction.

Which seems sad, but I can't blame him for not wanting to make his full-time yob. *shrugz* There seem to be a lot less hacker media projects around these days, too (No more shows from BRR, RFA, PhreakFactor, Default, DougTV, NewsReal ...); maybe we should look into starting something up.

Not sure what happened to bellsmind, but noticed that went away a while bax, too. 

So really I guess I'm saying I'm glad the phx2600 is still around. O_o!

Stank seems to have been unplugged but still lurks. I completely don't blame him either. He put so much energy in trying to maintain a positive community and people just seemed to crap all over that. I'm sure you can only put up the fight so long. And it really goes to show how much of the community he held together when everything seemed to die off when he unplugged.

Maybe we could start scheduling demos, tutorials, and talks for the meetings again.

I'm not an expert at anything but there are plenty of subjects I have experience with that I could present about.

Projects would be cool too but presentations and demos would be more episodic and less prone to gutter out like some of 

our previous projects.
