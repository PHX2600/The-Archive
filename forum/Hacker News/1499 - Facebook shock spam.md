You know when your stupid friends or acquaintances get owned on facebook and
then have spammy crap sent on their behalf? Well, this is the funny version.

HAHAHAH! Why doesn't awesome stuff like this ever happen to us? Is it just that
spammers have some secret unearned respect for us? Or do we not get hacked on
facebook because our suspicious nature prevents the attack from even being a
possibility?

We are people, too. We want to get hacked. Why are we being left out? :cry:

We need more stupid "friends" (facebook friends), those are the guys that bring
it in for us, I guess it's a somewhat good sign.
