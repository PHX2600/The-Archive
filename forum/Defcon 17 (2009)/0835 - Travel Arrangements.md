## Travel Arrangements
Posted by **Ghostshell** on Thu June 25th, 2009 12:09:31 PM

I will be driving to Sin City, anyone else driving? Anyone flying? Anyone want
to car pool?

Not sure yet; Was going to carpool, but the two others I was going with
cancelled, so I might fly instead.

I will be driving with wife, baby, and (I believe) Zapperlink.  All of us plus
luggage in my Corolla probably means I'm full.

However, I have stickied this topic for others to make travel arrangements with
each other.

Hi everybody! I'm back in phoenix for a little while (leaving for LA tomorrow)
but while I'm here I'll let my fellow beautiful hacker people know that I'll be
in Flagstaff during defcon time(I think...) and I don't own a car so it's either
going to be:

  1. Someone from phx drives to flag and picks me up on the way to LV (I know
  it's a bit out of the way)
  2. I greyhound it to LV
  3. I greyhound/hitchhike/hike/bike to a place where I meet someone on the way
  up to defcon (that isn't out of the way) OR
  4. I don't go to defcon and return my riv. room to some lucky late minute fool

peace, nak

Looks like I'll be unemployed by the time Defcon comes around but the severance
and retention bonus should be enough for me to make an appearance. I'll probably
drive up in my pickup so I have room for one more plus plenty of space for
hardware. Anyone need a ride?

The fiancee and myself are flying. We're leaving around 8:00 tomorrow morning or
something.
