The most up-to-date version of my gallery script is really 1.3.0.  Version 2.0.0 with the admin panel still isn't &quot;officially&quot; released.  However, you can download it from the 2.0.0 branch of the repository found here: <http&#58;//github&#46;com/PHLAK/ck-gallery/tree/2&#46;0&#46;0>.

Just remember that that many things are going to change from this version and the final &quot;official&quot; 2.0.0 version.  But this one should still be sufficient for your use.
