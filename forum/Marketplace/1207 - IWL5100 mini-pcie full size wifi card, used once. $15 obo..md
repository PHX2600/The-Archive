I have an Intel 5100 abgn mini-pcie card that has been used once. I purchased it for my Thinkpad X200 without knowing that Lenovo has a whitelist for wifi cards and will only work with Intel cards that have a Lenovo hardware ID. I didn't try anything crazy like modifying said hardware ID... I just picked up a Lenovo specific version on eBay. You're welcome to take a look at it and try it in your machine if you're careful. I'll bring it to the meeting if there's any interest. It looks like HP/Compaqs could be a problem as well.

This card should work with packet injection, although I haven't done the work to get mine working... I should by the next meeting.

*shakes fist at Lenovo*

Asking $15 or 20% less than what you can find it for new online (including shipping).
