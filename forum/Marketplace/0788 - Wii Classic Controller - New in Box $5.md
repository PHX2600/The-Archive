## Wii Classic Controller - New in Box $5
Posted by **dxh** on Sun April 5th, 2009 07:20:54 PM

Hey guys, I bought a Wii classic controller as a gift to a friend but to make a
long story short he broke up with his girlfriend and is no longer in possession
of a Wii.  Gamestop won't refund it and the trade-in value is arbitrarily weak;
I'd rather sell it to someone here so you won't have to buy it from them for
twice as much.

In any case, I'll bring it to the next meeting if no one wants to buy it from me
prior to May.

I would for the accelerometer and stuff but i have no way of charging it and I
have no wii to use it with.

seems like some sweet hardware hackability potential though.

I'm not sure if the Classic controller has the accelerometers and such that the
Wiimote has, however, the Wiimote is quite hackable and there's drivers out
there to make it a Linux pointer device, which can be used for stuff like
[Duck Hunt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fap00jsOBV8).
