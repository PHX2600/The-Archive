Posted by **dxh** on Mon June 13th, 2011 10:44:23 PM

Hey everyone,

I'm selling my Lenovo IdeaPad S10-3t.  It has a touchscreen that swivels and
supports Windows 7, MeeGo Netbook UX, and Ubuntu Netbook Remix really well, from
my experience.  I can't easily make it to PHX 2600 meetings, so if anyone wants
to pick this up at my home in Tempe, please PM me and I will deliver deets on
how to get there.

Specs:

  * 1.66GHz Intel Atom N455 processor with 512K L2 cache
  * 10.1" multitouch (sorta) LED rotatable dual-swivel hinge with front-facing
    camera
  * 250GB 5400rpm hard drive
  * Small USB bluetooth dongle included (its not built into the machine)
  * Comes with Ubuntu Netbook Remix
