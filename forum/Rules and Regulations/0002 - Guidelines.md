## Guidelines
Posted by **XlogicX** on Sat December 22nd, 2007 09:50:08 AM

I would like things to be as open as possible on the forums, however, there can be a downside to this. Because of this, there have to be a few guidelines set: 


1. No illegal activity. 2600 meeting guidelines specify that there should be no illegal activity at the meetings. Not only is this forum a function of the 2600 meetings, but it is also a public forum. So, not only would it be just stupid to post illegal stuff here, it is also not welcome. 

2. No flaming or threatening. No one knows everything. I can go to a computer un-savvy nurse and make fun of him or her about how little they know about computers, but someone needs to fix my dick when it gets cut off, and I sure don't know how to do that. My point is, people have their specialties, how about we share them in a humble manner. When arrogance hits, the meetings are uncomfortable, and that's not fun for anyone. I will also include being an asshole in this rule: dont be a dick. However, correcting people is encouraged, but please just correct the technical stuff, without the name calling or arrogance. Remember, your helping them out, and helping us out with credibility. Your not here to bring others down, there's just not enough of us as it now stands. 

3. Be relevant (or post in the off-topic section). There are different sections to the forum for a reason. If you just wanted to chat about your flux capacitor smuggling into space elevator, then bring it into the off topic. The reason for this rule, is just for credibility. It just takes one person talking about random in-credible stuff, to drive away 10 people with useful information. People probably wont get banned for this one unless it is blatantly bad (spam is a good example of this). Instead of banning this type of user, we will place them in the &quot;Trolling&quot; forum and allow only 1 post a week.


Unfortunately, users could get banned for breaking these rules. It's not something I would like to do, but I will in situations where a single user could be driving away many others by breaking any of these rules. 

Also, additional guidelines may apply in the sub forums. It is up to the moderators of those forums to make their own guidelines.
