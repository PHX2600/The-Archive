HAY GUISE, I'm looking for someone to contact at UAT about possibly using their awesome facilities to host an open source conference in late 2008.  If anyone can point me in the right direction, it would be very relevant to my interests...

Sounds pretty awesome, To the best of my Knowledge LosT is still a Prof. out there.

Not too sure how to contact him though....
