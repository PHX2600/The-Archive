## Best House/Residential locks

I get asked a lot what is the best house lock, and in reality their isn’t a good answer.  What good is a $1000 lock with a retinal scan, if the door protecting it is only 2” thick particle board? Of even worse if your front door has some ornate little glass windows begging to be punched out giving a thief access to the internal thumb turn. Let’s say your back door is a huge arcadia door made of glass.
	The truth is there is not an easy answer. The best protection is layered security. House alarm with various sensors. Various methods of physical security such as reinforced door frame. Internal dead man locks, bars on your windows, window films, guard dog, etc.
Good locks or uncommon style locks is a very good start. Locks that require specialized tools will usually deter most thief’s, because they can just move on to the next house. Let’s say a thief picked up a set of bump keys off the net, and you have Bi-Lock, Abloy or  Medeco locks. These simple variants’ in locks will deter most thief’s amateur or professional from accessing your home in that method.  Tools you should worry about more are crow bars, size 12 boot to the door, or a rock through the window.
Simple things like leaving a light on, stereo playing, TV on, will deter most people, but not all. The nosy retired neighbor keeping an eye on your house is like a 24/7 security guard.  Having secondary measures such as a safe, or hidden places for high value items i.e. hollowed out book, false floor storage, etc. is a great layer of security.  Remember time is $$$ and for a thief more time = more chance of getting caught.
When considering security think out of the box. Consider the most common ways thief’s enter homes, and have the mindset that they will enter it. This will help greatly when it comes to layering your security. The goal is to create as many obstacles as possible.  Purposely setup furniture so it is difficult to maneuver a TV out of the home or large electronics.  This includes room’s setup furniture in front of bedroom windows, limit entry and exit access.

Good stuff.  I knew some of this, but stuff like moving furniture is also good to know.
