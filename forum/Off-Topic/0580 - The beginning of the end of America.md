Just some interesting content that has been surfacing recently.

Olbermann tals about the "Military Commissions Act" and the death of Habeas Corpus:

FEMA has also setup several operational detention camps all over the U.S. manned and ready... why?

you can plop 33°33'57.36"N 83°29'6.26"W into Google earth or just the satellite view on google maps to see some of the above mentioned 

I don't want to be a crazy conspiracy theorist but damn, what is going on?

Must Stay Vigilant

On the lighter side this clip from the onion seems to be a satire of the recent events.

They were posting about this shit last week. They make up some new shit every day. One thread told me today 10-7-08 that the economy would collapse and Los Angeles would be nuked. It's all bullshit.

To err on the side of safety is logically sound, especially when it concerns large groups of (power hungry)people...

Just have to balance your thoughts about everything or else you can go a little ~MAD~

7 years and some odd months after 9/11 and i am more terrifed of the dhs, nsa and other 3 letter groups than i am of bin landen and the like. makes me question who is winning the war on terror?

There is no war on terror, it's a farce to carry out 'new world order' agendas.  Always has been.

As far as the beginning of the end of America... America ended in 1913 with the diabolic birth of the Federal Reserve System and the Internal Revenue Service.  

The whole point now is to create a one world government controlled by the international banking elite, kill at least half the population on earth, and get everyone chipped.
