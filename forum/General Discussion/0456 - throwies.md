You should see what Nak and friends did, it's you the youtubes, his handle is uberscientist.

I think we should do a group project like that, but something more creative, it's something some of us have been thinking of for a while.

Ok, well let's start brainstorming then.  A PHX2600 wide art project would be fun.  First, we must identify our objectives.  I think the following make reasonable objectives.

[b:2326bnlj]OBJECTIVES[/b:2326bnlj]
[list:2326bnlj]
[*:2326bnlj]Anyone willing should be able to participate in this project.[/*:m:2326bnlj]
[*:2326bnlj]This project should work with as few as 2 people and as many as 100+.[/*:m:2326bnlj]
[*:2326bnlj]Upon completion the project should be visible to the public, not just us. (my opinion)[/*:m:2326bnlj]
[*:2326bnlj]The project should be low budget or free.[/*:m:2326bnlj][/list:u:2326bnlj]

Any other Objectives you can think of?

Now with some initial objectives in place, start listing ideas that fit these objectives.

i saw the nak video with the on you tube a while was pretty cool 
defintley should be seen by more than just us and with a big enough group money should be pretty low cost and most of us probally have some recycleables that could be donated and used 
i was thinking an underpass would be a great spot but mainly just throwing ideas out there and see what everyone else wants do 
kinda like sex the more the merrier
