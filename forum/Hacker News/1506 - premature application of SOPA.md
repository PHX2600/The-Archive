## premature application of SOPA

This is disgusting.

A guy running a luxury business gets butt-hurt that there are other scam
websites (...or competition) for luxury items. He takes it to court. An
investigator samples 3 of the 228 sites and decides their all bad. Judge rules
to have all of them grabbed by go-daddy with a seizure page. Judge also rules to
have bing/yahoo/google de-list these domains.

WTF!, bad precedent.

Goodbye Internet, remember as animals we are not entitled to anything besides
our own personal bill of rights.

I heard about this case and was dumbfounded by the way the judge told the search
engines (who weren't involved in this case AT ALL), to remove the listings.  How
is that legal?

Imagine if you were to run a business and all of a sudden you got notice from a
judge that, due to a ruling in a case you weren't involved in and probably
didn't even hear about, you have to do something against your core business
practices.  That's is just f***ed up!
