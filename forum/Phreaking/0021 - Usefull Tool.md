Not sure where to put this, exactly... either here or Social Engineering,
because I imagine it could be used for both really.

Anyways, has anyone else heard of or checked out GrandCentral? It is a way to
get a phone number that you can link to whatever phone you have. At the moment
it is in beta and therefore free for the moment.

From the website ( <http://www.grandcentral.com> )

Hopefully we can make use of this, it has some nice features, like when someone
gives your GC number a call and you answer it gives you options of "Listen in as
they leave a message" "Ignore" and "Answer the call" I believe, and as well if
you make a call using your GC number you can hit the 4 key and start recording
the convo until you press 4 again and it is saved on the website like a
voicemail.

Check it out if you want to. My GC number is 623-455-6237 (That spells out ILL-
NADS lol )

What's extra cool is that you can sign up for a
[Gizmoproject](http://www.gizmoproject.com) account and forward your
GrandCentral number to that! You don't have to use Gizmoproject's gay ass app,
you can just connect to it via SIP. Just hit the sign up link on
[this page](http://gizmoproject.com/area775.html) to avoid the app,
and then use your favorite SIP client (Asterisk?) to connect to
proxy01.sipphone.com with your username/password.

Bling bling free incoming calls on a local number. Also, Gizmo lets you call
800/866/877 numbers.a
