Anyone interested? Could be a fun meet talking about discrete logic and wiring up some circuits.

Karnaugh mapping, ripple carry vs look ahead, time / space tradeoff.

Could be fun!

Here is a pretty sweeeet cross platform sim for basic logic circuits.

doesn't do spice type stuff but as long as you have a discrete logic system it should work.

Sounds Interesting, I still have lots of 7400 series chips laying around
