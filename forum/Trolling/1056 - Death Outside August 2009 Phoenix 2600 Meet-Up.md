## Death Outside August 2009 Phoenix 2600 Meet-Up
Posted by **jargon** on Tue August 11th, 2009 02:58:27 AM

A pedestrian got killed by an ambulance that struck them outside last Phoenix
2600 while the individual was crossing Glendale Avenue near 7th Place. This
event occurred at roughly 9PM. Glendale Avenue was entirely blocked off from 7th
Place to 12th Street.

Everyone that stuck around saw the bajillion police and Hans, the former cafe
owner, verified to me what actually occured. (He still owns Monster's Gelato.)
He asked the police to inform him so as to help him decide whether to close
early. He would have closed early if 20 people including 14 or 15 from Phoenix
2600 were not still active customers in the Cafe. (It is hard to do business
when the entire damn road is closed.)

Hans knows me personally. Btw, Phlak, help me get it into Zapperlink's head that
if he keeps attempting to interfere with my telecommuting from Phoenix 2600,
most likely Hans and any other cafe workers are not going to allow him *or
others* to use the WiFi anymore *if he other people do stuff like that*. (My
personal guess at to how they would handle it.) Only enforceable way obviously
would be to ban *such people* from the premises.It isn't a matter of screwing
around with the WiFi at the meet-up, it is the matter of impeding peoples'
livelihood. I used to screw around with the WiFi on a regular basis in order to
log the bandwidth speed, that the WLAN address rotation was working properly
etcetera and I damn well made sure they were aware I was logging for them
certain WLAN features and what they are and made damn sure that I wasn't
interfering with customer's connections and also made sure I didn't capture
anything personal nor their actual usage nor monitor anything personal nor
monitor any actual usage.

I guess it would make sense to note that neither I nor Hans have any idea who
was struck and killed. At-least not yet.

This is Hans btw. You can tell it is him really easy by the style of shirt and
how he wears his belt and cellphone.

Can you provide documented proof of said interactions? Blatant accusations
against me I do not take kindly and have been a faithful customer of the
establishment including buying extra drinks for people to support the use of
their space. I think you should investigate defamation of character before you
continue your random trolling banter.

 :lol: Chill, bro.

You just need to crank it down a notch and not be a tool. Remember, leave your
ego at the door when coming to Phoenix 2600. If you buy drinks for people that
is cool, but don't use that as a means to put yourself on a pedestal. Everyone
fouls up now and then. R-e-l-a-x. I was just stating the worst case scenario of
such actions. Only one sentence in my post was even involving you. I updated my
prior post in this thread with asterisks indicating what I changed from when I
unintentionally singled you out.

Nobody is in actual direct danger of being 86'd from the Cafe. I am just
pointing out that people that attend our meeting need to be more cautious
regarding DNS manipulation.

To be fair, I never told Hans about the DNS pollution at the meeting, and in
this thread I never said I told Hans any such thing. Who's feeling stupid now?
Sure sign of guilt right then and there on Zapperlink's part. :lol:

I'm not going to quote his post, once he realizes he was owned, Zapperlink will
likely either change or delete his response himself.

But, Yeah.. Someone really did get struck and killed by an ambulance less than a
quarter block down the street outside last meet-up.

I guess I need to reiterate my statement in another manner; can you prove your
claim "DNS pollution at the meeting" was caused by me? What I am seeing is blind
accusations of networking concepts you don't fully grasp which is not only
insulting to me but also insulting any dignity you have left in my mind.

Sorry, I was mistaken. According to my cell logs I called Kilo at 8:45:45PM,
this means the struck pedestrian occurred before then roughly 5 minutes after
Kilo left the meet-up prior. When I called Kilo, Kilo was okay, it wasn't him
that got struck. Apparently, Kilo was already well on the way home or whatever
when it occurred.

Sometime between 8:30PM and 8:40PM (???) an ambulance passed 7th Street and
Glendale Avenue on Glendale and raced East past the cafe.

The instant it passed 7th Place it supposedly veered erratically and slammed on
the breaks. (View was obstructed by a house outside the North-East East-side
window of the cafe, also partially obscured by the OPEN sign in the Window. (I
was directly observing both the first and second ambulance out the window I am
referring to at the time they passed by.)

Less than 3 to 5 minutes later a battalion of patrol cars arrived at the scene.

Less than 3 minutes after that a second ambulance pulled into the middle lane
then slowly approached, then a few minutes later did a U-turn and returned back
West down Glendale.

By 8:40 The police began redirecting traffic.

By 9PM the street was nearly closed off and the son of the cafe owner (the newer
female owner that bought the cafe from Hans) had asked police what occurred
while I stood smoking a pipe at the west parking lot entrance.

By 9:15PM or so Hans had already arrived and had talked with the police. Shortly
after, I confirmed with Hans that a single pedestrian not two was hit by the
first ambulance, and had died virtually instantly.

By this time Hans had decided to close the cafe when Phoenix 2600 would leave as
long as there wasn't more on-foot customers.

About an hour or more later I left and 2/3rd of Phoenix 2600 had already left in
two clusters; Nearly a third of us left for IHOP at the North-East corner of
19th Avenue and Glendale, and within an hour another third of the meet-up had
gone home. When I left roughly a third or fourth of the meet-up was still
present.

As far as I know I was the only person at the cafe with the best final glimpse
of the first ambulance.

This may be unrelated, but I noticed a muted grey sedan with heavy driver's side
damage slowly pass the Cafe heading West and continue through the intersection
some time after the police had nearly closed off the street.
