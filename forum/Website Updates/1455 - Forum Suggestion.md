## Forum Suggestion
Posted by **nak** on Thu September 8th, 2011 01:03:35 PM

Anyone think it's time to clean up inactive moderators and maybe kill off dead
forums?

Yes.  I have a major site rework in the pipes (though still a little ways off)
and I plan on moving the forums to [fluxbb](https://fluxbb.org/) (simpler,
faster, less bloated).  At that time I was going to clean house a little and
re-organize.  I'll probably ask for volunteers to fill in as moderators where
needed.

Yeah, moderator info is a bit dated. We could probably hash that part out pretty
quickly (as that doesn't require a software update). Having as many subforums as
we do kind of saturates a small community like ours, I initially (years and
years ago) started out broad and started splintering the sub forums by
popularity. I suppose we can talk about which sub forums we would like to see
stay/go at the meeting.

Yeah, I actually had very stripped down sub-forums initially, then started
creating them based on the actual posts made.

Trolling is no exception. For those that don't know who Jargon is; he's been
known to troll. I'm not ban-happy, but he eventually asked to be banned enough
times and got banned. Later down the road, phpBB offered more permission
flexibility. It was possible to limit Jargon to just one sub-forum and the
ability to only post once a week. This was perfect, and the Troll forum was
created.

Trolling is no exception...? to?

Trolling was no exception to my judgment to create sub-forums based on demand.

Ah, understand now.

what constitutes "inactive"?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Valveritas** on Fri December 9th, 2011 03:18:19 PM

Does Jargon have the ability to receive PMs on here?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jargon should have the ability, he sure has the ability to send them :o

He doesn't send me anything. :( :lol:
