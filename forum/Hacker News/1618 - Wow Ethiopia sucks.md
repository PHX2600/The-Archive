Sorry for spamming a bunch of news recently, but this is also really
interesting. Ethiopia is banning Skype, Google Talk, and VOIP in general, it
holds a 15 year prison sentence. TOR is also against the rules, and they are
attempting deep packet inspection to block it (not sure if that is 100%
effective though).

"they imposed these bans because of 'national security concerns' and to protect
"the state’s telecommunications monopoly. The country only has one ISP, the
"state-owned Ethio Telecom, and has been filtering its citizen’s Internet access
"for quite some time now to suppress opposition blogs and other news outlets.

Doing it wrong. :cry:
