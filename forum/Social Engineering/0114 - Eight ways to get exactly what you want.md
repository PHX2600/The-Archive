## Eight ways to get exactly what you want

From Lifehacker, here's a good read on manipula... I mean, persuasion:

Some observations:

- 1. Is this psychologically similar to the &quot;Sullivan nod?&quot;
- 4. &quot;Conversely, if you're trying to be persuasive, strike when your target is running low on mental energy.&quot; Religious fast anyone?
- 7. Anger comes from fear. Anger is when thought becomes irrational from fear of danger or past trauma (abuse). This is not just Yoda, this is the limbic system of the brain.
- 8. We see this with neocons and you can hear it on Rush Limbaugh.

I'd love to hear other comments as, as crazy as some hackers are, hackers are amateur psychologists.

I find myself mimicking without even thinking about it, at work I acquired an accent while I was helping some customers with a southern accent.

Also using the &quot;feeling sorry&quot;, &quot;desire to help&quot; or &quot;pity&quot; emotion to persuade also works... &quot;It's been really slow today, I don't think we're going to make the day, this purchase would really help us out!&quot; etc
