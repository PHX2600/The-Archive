I won't be around basically the whole first half of November, however, I will attend a 2600 meeting that day, whatever city I happen to be in at that time.

Congratulations ahead of time man!

I will make it, I will be bringing my usually stuff + a little more. I will also have a few give away items again if you missed out last time. If you need a ride Nak, or anyone else who is on my way send me a PM. 

Bring your picks <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

A young lady and gentleman at Unlimited, Scout and Josh I think, informed me that we should expect a full house this meeting as Monsoon Voices, a poetry reading event, is the same night. They'll have extra tables and they said they'll make sure to accommodate us. Personally, I can't wait to hear the improvisational flute:

I'll be there. 

I just got a shiny new laptop, and am still in the process of getting it &quot;properly&quot; configured. I've got a wonderful triple boot setup on my desktop, but am having the damndest time getting it working on the laptop. I'll probably take the time to mess with that. (Trying to get the built in wifi with a broadcom chip to work with rfmon and injection. No luck thus far. I may give up and buy a separate card that WILL work)

I'll bring my picks as well. But I'm afraid I don't have any super-cool locks to share.

I'll be there, I brought something else that I built with my propeller, nothing too cool, but I have source code for this one for anyone that is interested. I will bring it on a thumb drive, but plan to upload it blog wise to the site later, just haven't gotten around to playing with the wordpress just yet.

I went to the Pocatello 2600 meeting in a lovely 42 degree weather and missed out, being in Idaho and all.  No one else showed up.  Potato Republic FAIL. :/
