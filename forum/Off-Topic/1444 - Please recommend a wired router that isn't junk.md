## Please recommend a wired router that isn't junk

Currently I'm using the D-Link EBR-2310 travesty.  Apparently it's notorious for losing packets and working like shit.  
But otherwise, it's fucking awesome!

Of course that router won't work! Here try this one instead for a network your size: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/routers/ps5855/prod_qas0900aecd8016a953.html">http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collate ... 6a953.html</a><!-- m -->

Wow, I'm definitely buying that.  I'll never know when I need all those features.  

You'd think for 9k it'd have more than a 2 year warranty though.... sigh.

The only reason I replaced this router is because it only uses 10/100 ports and doesn't do wireless N.  I actually still use it as a dedicated G/B access point, just not my main router.  Never had any hardware problems with it, and as long as you use one of the aforementioned custom firmwares, the software is rock solid and feature rich as well.

I assume you can turn off the wireless features of this router easily?  If so, it would work for my purposes, but might still cost more than a wired router of comparable quality.

I didn't realize you just wanted a wired router.  But yes, you can easily disable wireless after installing DD-WRT or Tomato.
