I'm sure this is done on purpose for legal/copyright reasons.  However, you can always [url=http&#58;//www&#46;vikitech&#46;com/950/stream-convert-and-save-youtube-videos-using-vlc-media-player:1rwftfcz]use trusty ol' VLC to save those Youtube videos[/url:1rwftfcz].

[quote=&quot;Valveritas&quot;:10oyexxq]Thanks! My god, this app is quite spiffy.  <!-- s:shock: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><!-- s:shock: -->[/quote:10oyexxq]

VLC is my goto media player. It will play every common format (.avi, .mp4, .wmv, .flv, .mkv) and most obscure ones, too.  It's also FOSS and available on Linux and Windows.
