## Free Issues of the Hacker Monthly
Posted by **XlogicX** on Sat December 24th, 2011 12:41:37 AM

This is a limited Christmas only offer, all issues (18 months) are free for download. I think it's normally $29 a year.

Short notice, I know, I'll bring them to the meeting if anybody was too late.

and don't thank me, I found out from Pablo/BoBB (yeah, I remember old handles).

I will have them on me at the next meeting, although, if memory serves me correctly, I think I've only seen you there once or twice (several years ago). Otherwise, I prefer secure-copy, but that would require you having a shell (temporary even) listening on SSH.
