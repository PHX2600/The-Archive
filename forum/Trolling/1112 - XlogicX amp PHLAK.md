Please grant me regular user status so I can actually respond to topics and
posts and actually be able to talk to people that need supplies for
presentations so I actually verify to bring them. Only 3 or 4 people actually
read the troll board on a regular basis.

Otherwise please remove the troll rank and make me an admin so I can create a
freenode group contact form in order to be able to own the actual #phx2600
channel and not dick around with ##phx2600, be able to assign phx2600 cloaks on
freenode, be able to upload meet-up videos and photos, and be able to put dates
and info on the calendar.

I keep track of when potential meet-up locations will suite the group's needs
and what hours they will be open. I photograph and videotape the meet-ups. I
keep the chatroom and chat software up to snuff. I keep the telephreak.org pbx's
"phx2600 skype piggyback gateway" going. I keep phx2600 members in touch with
other means to access the telephreak.org VoIP conference. I keep the group on
good terms with the meet-up locations outside the meet-ups.

Why do you keep jerking me around? Stop being a prick. You are breaking the
rules of your own group.

So assuming that I am reading that correctly with all caps... you sir just
yelled your request at the admins....

Though if there is a urgent need for the IRC medium... I am sure the admins are
more than willing to register the content officially as admins so that
everything is managed as a identity instead of rogue mediums all over the
internet.

As far as the admin status, I would have to say that your behavior in this post
is not what people would consider a mature manner in handling a request and
tarnishes your reputation in being able to properly handle public tasks.
Trolling is for trolls, if you have people who cannot contact you via all the
other posts you are more than welcome to privately contact them but your past
behavior has given many people the impression your not able to handle yourself
well enough to not flood our boards with nonsense.

I already pm'd them twenty some times over the past 5(?) months without any kind
of response what-so-ever.

They don't seem to give a flying crap about IRC.

You are a tool and a troll. Nobody asked you. A large portion of the regular
users of this forum have no clue why I have troll status.

Zapperlink, the reason you are a tool and a troll is you think it is funny to
bait people with mental illnesses or other emotional disorders, and do so often.
