The &quot;telemarketers are gonna ravage your young, white, pretty cell phone&quot; email is _still_ going around. My wife had it sent to her last Wednesday and, knowing the hoax, sent it to me to demonstrate the noobz she works with:
[quote:2zplvml1]Reminder..10 days from today, all cell phone numbers are being released to telemarketing companies and you will start to receive sales calls.

….YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR THESE CALLS 

To prevent this, call the following number FROM YOUR CELL PHONE:  888-382-1222 

It is the National DO NOT CALL list.  It will only take a minute of your time, and it blocks your number for 5 yrs.  You must call from the number you want blocked and they will ask you for the phone #.

Help others by passing this on to all your friends.[/quote:2zplvml1]
Love the caps.

From the [url=http&#58;//www&#46;ftc&#46;gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt107&#46;shtm:2zplvml1]FTC[/url:2zplvml1]:
[quote:2zplvml1]You may have received an email telling you that your cell phone is about to be assaulted by telemarketing calls as a result of a new cell phone number database; however, that is not the case. FCC regulations prohibit telemarketers from using automated dialers to call cell phone numbers. Automated dialers are standard in the industry, so most telemarketers don’t call consumers on their cell phones without their consent.[/quote:2zplvml1]

Next, is it just me, or does Chatterbug use a T-Mobile subscriber's number as an example on their sign up page?

Some lady answered the first time I called and I got voice mail the second.

Thanks for posting. My g/w mentioned this to me. She got it from her supervisor.   <!-- s:roll: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><!-- s:roll: -->

Interesting, did you tell her that her phone number was the example on chatterbug's site?  <!-- s:-) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:-) -->
