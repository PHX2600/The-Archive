Free to a good home. Or a reasonably good home. Hell, free to anyone who wants to do something with it other than just chuck it in the trash. LOL

Dell 2600 Server (ID FF0SD31) -- Look it up at [url=http&#58;//bit&#46;ly/4vXzIB:2xclwp6i]Dell's[/url:2xclwp6i] site to see the specs.

This is an old server that was pulled (in working condition) from a client. I've wiped the data and re-initialized the RAID 5 on the unit.
