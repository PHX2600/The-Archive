[color=#FF8000:2aeh3pq4]May[/color:2aeh3pq4] meeting comming up.

AltF4 was talking about maybe looking into the [color=#FF0000:2aeh3pq4]CTF quals for Defcon[/color:2aeh3pq4] coming up

I'm going to start rebuilding my [color=#4000FF:2aeh3pq4]Auto turret[/color:2aeh3pq4] for the con, I think this year I'll call it &quot;Auton-2&quot;

[color=#00BFFF:2aeh3pq4][b:2aeh3pq4]Who else is going? [/b:2aeh3pq4][/color:2aeh3pq4]

Anyone else gearing up for[i:2aeh3pq4] [color=#00FF40:2aeh3pq4]Defcon[/color:2aeh3pq4]?[/i:2aeh3pq4]

I'd be willing to hang out with some CTF quals, what would be the best thing to brush up on? How to use GDB? I am trying to remember the kinds of stuff from the year that they did the jepordy style contest for the quals. I remember a PPC binary and a weird question I couldn't understand even with google's help.
Maybe I'll go to the meeting, it's not too far from my dad's house.
keep me updated pengu

I'll be there this meeting. 

I made a thread for the CTF quals: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://www.phx2600.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1396">viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1396</a><!-- l --> Come check it out! It'll be super fun.

How was the meeting folks? Didn't make it, lack of motivation/transport are my excuses.
