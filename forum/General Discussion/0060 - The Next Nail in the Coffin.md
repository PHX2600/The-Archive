## The Next Nail in the Coffin?

I'm not too sure where this goes, but here goes.....

I just woke up this morning to find that MxF'er Bush talking on CNN about giving telcom companies retroactive immunity from prosecution in lawsuits over privacy issues stemming eavesdropping on communications. I have also found out that the Senate has passed a bill last night, granting immunity to telcoms that eavesdrop for the government; this involves ISPs, cable companies, telco, etc. The House has to vote on this and some say it faces stiff opposition there. However, Bush has a nasty habit of getting his way. All in the name of fighting t*ism.  <!-- s:evil: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /><!-- s:evil: -->

Alright people, you know what to do. Congressmen, phone numbers, etc.

PS I believe McC voted in favor of passing this bill. I'll check later today.
