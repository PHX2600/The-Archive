Yeah, I have an oldschool beige phone just laying around, I'll bring it to the next meeting for whomever wants to take it.

For those not old enough ( <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> ), it looks something like this:

probably, I left it at the meeting when I brought it. I might as well lock this thread too <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( -->, sorry.
