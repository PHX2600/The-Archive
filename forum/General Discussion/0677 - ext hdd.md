Good question bro, I have never tried running an OS off an external hdd, 
don't know if I would want to though lol.

I know some hardware vendors support booting from a thumb drive now, 
don't see why it would be any different than that so it should be doable.

Im thinking maybe check for a bios setting see if you can set USB media in the boot order list or something liek that.

Good Luck!

Its quite possible, and popular with small distros like Damn Small Linux.  See: <http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/wiki/index.php/USB_Booting> and <http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2007/01/25/usb-x-ubuntu-610/>.

Slax, which is based on Slackware, also has a usb-booting specific version on their download page: <http://www.slax.org/get_slax.php>

If your hardware supports it, a USB device can be used to load an OS. You would most likely need a boot manager, though.
