I know many people will be at Defcon, but for those who aren't you can help Penguin and I on the Crack Me If You Can competiton (see: [url=http&#58;//www&#46;phx2600&#46;org/forum/viewtopic&#46;php?f=36&amp;t=1260:3ll24i5y]this thread[/url:3ll24i5y] for more details).  Those who are going to the con can help @TwtrHatingMatt and AltF4 at the con.

The first Friday is the 6th, yes? So that's after Defcon, nor during.

We could use help for the contest, in any case.

Ahh... yes, you're right.  I have added a 2550 meeting to the calendar for the Friday during the con in hopes that everyone not going to the con can meet up to work on things.

Looks like I'll have my hands on that little $150 Android tablet that Kmart was selling.

I'll play with it to get a feel for it, and bring it on 8/6/10

I'll be coming this Friday, after all.

I'm going to switch out the internal wifi card on my laptop with a different one, but I can't get the stupid case open! There are two screws that are super tight, and my screwdrivers just aren't doing the trick. Plus I don't want to strip the screws. Anyone got a nice set of small screwdrivers that they might bring to give me a hand?

I'll also be doing a short demo on using your PC as a keyboard &amp; screen for an Android phone.

I'll be at the meeting in SPIRIT.

In Physical form I'll be in flagstaff hanging out with NaK.

maybe we could setup a remote visual link and colocate the meeting.

Then I'll just have to give your spiritual self the free t-shirt that I got for you from the password cracking competition. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

Beware, I'm making it next time. Hopefully, my arm candy won't have melted by then!

Is the board dying? What's this, hacker's of the valley unite and post your asses off. J/K.
