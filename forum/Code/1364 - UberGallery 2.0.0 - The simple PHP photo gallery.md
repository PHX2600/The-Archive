## UberGallery 2.0.0 - The simple PHP photo gallery
Posted by **PHLAK** on Fri December 24th, 2010 04:16:12 PM

So, a while back while I was learning PHP, Dual and I were squaring off to develop different, but relatively equal, photo galleries (mine in PHP his in [strike:2jbof20q]Pearl[/strike:2jbof20q] Perl).  Well, it's been a while since anything has come of that but that ends now, for yesterday I pushed v2.0.0 of UberGallery!

[size=150:2jbof20q]Check it out at: <http&#58;//www&#46;UberGallery&#46;net>[/size:2jbof20q]

For those not familiar with UberGallery, here's a quick quote to hopefully peak your interest:

[quote:2jbof20q]UberGallery is an easy to use, simple to manage, web photo gallery written in PHP and dual licensed under the MIT License and GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 3. UberGallery does not require a database and supports JPEG, GIF and PNG file types. Simply upload your images and UberGallery will automatically generate thumbnails and output standards compliant XHTML markup on the fly.[/quote:2jbof20q]
