Awesome Pandora alternative I found: Libre.fm. (<!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.libre.fm">www.libre.fm</a><!-- w -->)

- Free Software client and server
- Creative Commons licensed music
- Independent Artists
- Privacy preserving (No data harvesting)
- Liking and disliking songs to help automatically determine what songs you like to hear. 
- Good music

I really liked their Ambient playlist. No words, just really chill music. Perfect for coding. I had a really productive day. XD
