## Introduction
Posted by **ThatGuy** on Tue March 18th, 2008 02:05:02 PM

Hello All

I didn't see an intro thread so I thought this would be the place for it. I just wanted to give a brief introduction of myself and why I am here. I am a native from AZ but, I have been out of the country for several years. My main interest and hobby/addiction is physical security in all aspects, lock picking, by-passing, social engineering, etc.. I was looking to try and join a LSI group but there seems to be none here. I also come from an IT background so everything with IT security also fascinates me and I have found several fields of interest over the year that I have dabbled in. Mainly mobile, and wireless security. I hope to bring to the table all of the things I have learned and help in any way that I can to further promote that security threw ignorance is not the way. I have a ton of gear and cool toys as far as locksmithing supplies go. I am basically here to learn as much as possible and help out any way I can. I hope this isn't out of bounds with netetiquete, but I didn't just want to lurk around the forums forever.

Thank you all, I hope to be an active member, and help out in any way I can. I also dabble in free energy as I have seen some related subjects. I hope I can provide some insight on that as well.

Sounds good.  <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> This is really a very knowledgeable and skilled group IMO, and there are many that have impressed me in someway.  But on the other hand, there are always some things that could be improved (and probably should be...)
