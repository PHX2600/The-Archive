I bet that's sort of a fun job using/writing programs to weigh how likely something is to be juicy.  The data sets would be huge, even if they were "spying" on public messages... I wonder what kind of system they have setup to do all that crunching.

Their word list includes:

Grid
Power
Smart 
Mexico 
Twister
Tsunami
Earthquake 
etc...

If they're collecting data from all of Facebook and Twitter, they should rename themselves to the Department of False Positives.
