Sup? New to Phoenix. You going to make a run at CTF? If so, I'm down. 

Poo = Sony Vaio VGN-NW310F 
OS = Unix (FreeBSD 8.0 custom VM) / Linux (BT4 Final VM) on Win7 base install. 
Notes = New Laptop is Intel DCoreD 2.33 with 4GB + 500GB  just released from Sony. It's going to be a pain in the azz to get FreeBSD 8.0 converted into a custom VM if kernel cooperates.

ToOlz = Whatever's needed. Nessus, Metasploit, whatever.... You know, the basics.

School should be out by the time CTF quals are up. So yea, totally. I'd be down for a CTF run. 

Where are you originally from parable? Welcome to Phoenix. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

EDIT: Though maybe this would be better if we made a DC18 topic.

damn cant fathom how fast this last year went by. trying to work out a deal with my mom to take my kids so we can make it to defcon this year. If we get enough of us going lets try to do up our own phx2600 badges.
