Not sure where to put this, exactly... either here or Social Engineering, because I imagine it could be used for both really.

Anyways, has anyone else heard of or checked out GrandCentral? It is a way to get a phone number that you can link to whatever phone you have. At the moment it is in beta and therefore free for the moment.

From the website ( [url:1hsztsk0]http&#58;//www&#46;grandcentral&#46;com[/url:1hsztsk0] )

GrandCentral Basics: About GrandCentral
	
GrandCentral gives you 'One Number...for Life' -- a phone number that instead of being tied to a device or a location, is tied to you. Use GrandCentral to centralize your communication, customize your callers' experience, and make sure you never miss a call you want to take (or take a call you want to miss).

GrandCentral isn't just another VoIP call service. We've tapped into VoIP technology to build our service, but GrandCentral works with cell phones, desk phones, VoIP lines, and everything in between. There's nothing to download, upload, or install, and you don't have to make or take calls using a computer.

GrandCentral will let you define which phones ring, based on who's calling, and even let you ListenInTM on voicemail before answering the call. We use smart technology to route your calls. So, if you're already on a GrandCentral call, we'll recognize it and use call waiting to reach you on the phone you're on. [/quote:1hsztsk0]

Hopefully we can make use of this, it has some nice features, like when someone gives your GC number a call and you answer it gives you options of &quot;Listen in as they leave a message&quot; &quot;Ignore&quot; and &quot;Answer the call&quot; I believe, and as well if you make a call using your GC number you can hit the 4 key and start recording the convo until you press 4 again and it is saved on the website like a voicemail.

Check it out if you want to. My GC number is 623-455-6237 (That spells out ILL-NADS lol )

What's extra cool is that you can sign up for a [url=http&#58;//www&#46;gizmoproject&#46;com:2mnw7pg4]Gizmoproject[/url:2mnw7pg4] account and forward your GrandCentral number to that! You don't have to use Gizmoproject's gay ass app, you can just connect to it via SIP. Just hit the sign up link on [url=http&#58;//gizmoproject&#46;com/area775&#46;html:2mnw7pg4]this page[/url:2mnw7pg4] to avoid the app, and then use your favorite SIP client (Asterisk?) to connect to proxy01.sipphone.com with your username/password.

Bling bling free incoming calls on a local number. Also, Gizmo lets you call 800/866/877 numbers.
