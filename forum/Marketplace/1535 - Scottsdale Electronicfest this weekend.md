## Scottsdale Electronicfest this weekend
Posted by **Junker** on Fri January 13th, 2012 12:59:46 PM

Just wanted to put out a reminder for the monthly electronicfest this weekend.
This happens the third Sunday of every month, it's at the 101and Indian Bend in
Scottsdale by the 5 and Diner. Lots of great finds at this monthly event if
anyone is looking for not so new electronics, they usually have cell phones,
lots of computers, the occasional ham equipment, weird obscure stuff, IC
programmers, business automation equipment, and just about anything you can
imagine, get there EARLY though, and bring a FLASHLIGHT Sunday 5:00 - 11:00 AM.
The good & cheap stuff goes fast, though most vendors don't fully finish setting
up until later, it's best to get there early and go through stuff as people are
setting up. Vendor spot is $20 and gets you two parking spaces. Hope this is the
right category.

Also I recommend bringing your own static bags, and a sleeping bag or blanket to
wrap the stuff in your trunk or back of vehicle when you're bringing it home.
And be careful, examine components closely, some people selling stuff that has
been wet, or is visibly bad (blown caps, rust on boards, smashed CPU pins, etc.)
