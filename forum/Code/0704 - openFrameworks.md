Yeah they include other libraries with oF (including openCV!)

I was trying to figure out how to do the linking of openCV to a virtual MIDI out interface and someone sent me a video of this library in action (maybe it was phlak).

Anyway I just installed bloodshed again, people are getting into C and C++ <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->
