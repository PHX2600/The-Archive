## Defcon CTF Quals (6/3 - 6/5)
Posted by **AltF4** on Tue May 3rd, 2011 09:40:02 PM

(Firstly, I didn't know what room to put this thread in. So maybe move it, I dunno.)

I'm planning on doing the Defcon CTF quals this year. I already registered "Phx2600" as a team. hashtag: a916a3df55dd478149908f342a7c25d4a55b1c3d for anyone who wants to sign up as well. (Signing up is not required. But it's the only way you can submit answers. Obviously at least ONE person on the team has to sign up.)

Infos here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=12076">https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=12076</a><!-- m -->

For those of you not familiar, the Defcon CTF qualifier is an online competition that will be happening on the weekend of June 3rd. (Which will coincide with the June meeting nicely!)

It takes the form of a Jeopardy style quiz game, with categories such as Trivia, Forensics, Web Hacking, Cryptography, Binary exploitation, Binary reversing, etc... you can find writeups and explanations of some past games here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nopsr.us/">http://nopsr.us/</a><!-- m --> and probably other places around the net.

I want to make the following clear:
1) I'm doing this entirely for the fun and educational value of it. This is nothing serious, so don't get all worked up!
2) In line with our 2600 rules, there will be a spirit of acceptance of everyone. Nobody will be ridiculed for not being as sup3r 1337 as anyone else. Don't be shy!
3) Don't think you're not valuable! The teams that do the CTF have at least a dozen people. For quals, sometimes well more. Nobody on any team knows everything, they each know just one small thing. That's what makes it a team. So don't be intimidated just because you couldn't answer the questions on the recap pages. 

I happen to know a thing-or-two about networks, protocols, and cryptography. But only have a modest understanding of binary exploitation. I know for a fact that some people here are good with web hacking. We need all kinds of different experiences for a good team!

I figure the June meeting will be a good place to start out. Since it's our natural meeting time and place, and we might hook some people in. But the contest goes on all weekend. We can collaborate online and/or hang out at my house. I'll have lots of free food and drinks for whoever wants to come and chill and hack. (PM me for details, or ask me in person. I don't want to post my address)

Hope to see you!
-Alt

are nootropics, smart-drugs and tDCS allowed?  ... I kid, I kid, so this year will be jeopardy style too!  I tried by my lonesome one year, it was frustrating seeing the answers to some problems that required skill way above my level.  Speaking of binary exploitation and stuff, that's something I've always been interested in and have fiddled with, however I would consider myself quite the noob, 0x90 sliiiiide (on the x86... they had a PPC binary the year I tried...and I didn't know gdb at all if I did then I would've got it).  Aight, let's take this super serious #1 foreva!!! <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

Some things that I think will come in handy / stuff to get to prepare:

- VM's of pretty much every OS. Loads of times there's a problem that makes you run a binary on some weird system, or just something different. Or sometimes makes you use a utility found on that system. Every *BSD you can think of, a few Linux distros, Wind0ze and apple maybe even. BeOS? I dunno.

- Some packages that I found useful / needed to use that are on the Ubuntu repos:
Sleuthkit (autopsy for a GUI frontend), dissy, scalpel, rifiuti

VirtualBox is being a nerd when I try to start up a FreeBSD system... I'll figure it out (unless someone else knows how) and post here.

Then this guys says this: 
[quote:1oio59ut]So uh... What's the difference between "linux", "linux-generic", and "linux-generic-pae"? It seems out of the three I have linux-generic-pae installed.

I had installed the source for the standard linux kernel, but not generic-pae.

Rather than change my kernel and risk screwing something up, I looked at the available packages relating to linux-generic-pae and found the relevant linux-headers package was not installed. Installing this -- then reinstalling virtualbox-ose-dkms -- fixed the issue.

Thank you for your assistance.[/quote:1oio59ut]
But he doesn't say, and I did an apt-cache search and I couldn't find smeg... so I sent him a PM.

Sweet. Sounds like you've got something at least.

I'm not sure what's going on with practice. Penguin was talking last week about getting together on Saturday, but now I can't get a hold of him. I hear he's out of town, so I don't know the status of any practice get-togethers.

Plus Saturday is rapture, and I have to prepare for that obviously.

Well it was fun Alt, Penguin...

Yea, man it was super fun. I'm only just recovering from the weekend. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

In retrospect, we definitely could have easily done a lot better. We were so close on a number of the challenges, but were just missing one little clue to break it open. For300 I had the right idea, I was going under the assumption that it was probably some GPS coordinates based on the phone's location or something. I just lacked any kind of tools to actually extract it. Similar for some other problems. We were right on track with GB100, but never thought to try the Google SPDY thing. Might have come to us with more heads. 

Next time we'll come more prepared with tools, expertise, and additional teammates. A typical team size is around 10 or so, and we only really had 3. Next go, I'll spend a lot of effort before-hand trying to assemble a proper team for the whole event. 

I noticed that ASU had a CTF team in the iCTF. (The pwndevils) I should find more about them. It would be good for us in general to reach out to them anyway. New hackers are always welcome.
