Here is one I made to start the ball rolling!

This is "The Bashanator". This is simply a sliced 1 Gallon Skim Milk Jug I
bought directly across the street from my condo at Bashas. The bottom of the jug
is a raincatcher with handy-dandy handle and the top of the jug is a bonus
funnel for redirecting rain water without spilling it all over the goddamn
place! I made this entry a week before monsoon season was officially announced,
and tested it last Tuesday. I use the funnel mostly to pour left-over salsa and
hot sauce back into my Pace Picante jars, which is especially helpful for when I
want to mix HOT Pace Picante Sauce with Pace Chunky Salsa! The jug just sits on
the flagstone in the middle of my courtyard awaiting rain, leaves and dirt often
end up in it so maybe someone can make a better entry that addresses such
issues. I caught half a centimeter of Rain this past week!

-Update-

Prizes updated due to cash flow issues.
