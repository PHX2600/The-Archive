Whelp I was gonna torrent the stuff and play for fun but I couldn't find a source so I applied, i guess I'm gonna get a packet of stuff in the mail. If anyone else wants to take a shot ill make some duplicates for the next meet and we can collaborate.

So far its been going good for me and the challenges have been interesting. I will admit I should dedicate more time to it.
