## The KEAL Show
Posted by **jargon** on Sun November 8th, 2009 03:34:48 AM

The on-demand replay from last night's &quot;KEAL Show&quot; is up, if you click a URL in this page you end up automatically deejaying the show in reverse where the show broadcasts to you, instead of from you, via simulcast:
[url:313z9rbv]http&#58;//thekealshow&#46;com/replays/[/url:313z9rbv]

The last segment in the on-demand replay is fucking hilarious. I hope to have 200% more mindfuck in my next episode.

Feel free to leave show comments and questions, etc in this thread.
