## Captcha not showing for failed login(s)
Posted by **fightgar** on Thu May 12th, 2011 11:52:27 AM

The captcha for trying to login too many times doesn't show up, I tried logging in on my other (main) name and it seems like either you have the attempt limit set to one or someone has been trying to hax &quot;nak&quot;

Anyway, the captcha didn't show up, so I gave up and just signed in, I sorta like this name, maybe I'll stick with it or start another account <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) --> jk

Well, I just tried starting another account, and that's disabled, which I can understand.  Probably to stop spam bots and feds from getting in here right? <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

I am sorta sad that I can't get into my &quot;real&quot; account ;3;

I believe registration is back open, FYI.  If not, or if you have problems, let me know.
