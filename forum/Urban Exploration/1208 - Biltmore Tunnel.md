## Biltmore Tunnel
Posted by **skrique** on Tue February 9th, 2010 06:44:07 PM

Hi I'm skrique (pronounced skreek). I'm excited to have found phx2600 as it seems to be in alignement with a lot of things I like. I was very impressed to see a UE section on the forum.  Which brings me my first post yay!

I'm way into exploring and I've been to a lot of places here and other places in the US. The first place I want to share with you is the Biltmore tunnel. If you haven't gone to this you should check it out. Start at the southeast entrance because I think the northeast entrance is close to a police station. Report back to me once you've examined it and I'll share more. Share your pics if you go!

PS. Advanced users may want to check out the two 'house' icons on the map, as they are also abandoned.

PPS. AltF4, the Tempe Mill is not occupied by bums anymore since security patrols it nightly. It's inaccessible though, so you can forget it for now.

Welcome skrique!  Glad to have you in the forums and hope to see you at a meet.

As to your UE suggestion, I'll see what I can do about checking this area out one day.

I went to the meet earlier this month. It was my first time.

Anyone up for going through the tunnel this Sunday?  May be our last chance before triple digit temps. I've got a big rig so we can shuttle from the NE entrance to the SE, and I plan on skating through.  I've got an extra board if someone needs it.  Barring...

Build up of dangerous gases
Rabid bats
Open pits

...it should be a fun trip (j/k btw).  Bring a big flashlight and maybe a camera and water and let's go exploring!

Go skating with dual or do the mothersday thing with the mother of my children. If I can figure out a way to avoid the whole hallmark holiday I will go.

Oh crap, that's mother's day?

How about midday Saturday?  And looking at the map (&lt;3 google earth plugin) how about we just walk the not-quite couple miles?

I can't believe that I missed this. I totally would have gone. Owell, I'll probably still go anyway.
