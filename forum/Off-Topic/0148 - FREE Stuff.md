## FREE Stuff
Posted by **ThatGuy** on Mon July 14th, 2008 11:15:07 PM

Hello All,

I have some old electronic stuff I would like to give away becuase I am going to throw it away. If anyone one is interested I will bring it to the next meeting. 

I have the following  

Wireless European router NIB ~220volt
NIB USB Dual action joystick 
Used Logitech Extreme 3D pro joystick 
and a few other things if I can dig them up. I thought maybe one of you guys might be able to use them for a project or something.

If anyone is ever throwing away old locks, keys, Safes, lock boxes, please hook me up.

Its yours just ask for it at the next meeting. If any of you guys have old keys I can make them into bump keys for you. I like to make bump keys out of the OEM keys becuase they are nickel silver and really strong compared to after market key blanks. I code cut everything to factory specs with my key machine.
