## Hardware Hacking Taken to Extremes
Posted by **reteo** on Thu February 28th, 2008 05:21:00 PM

I've been rather occupied lately, as I've been preparing to research an entirely
new area of hacking... hardware hacking.  No, not motherboards, microchips, or
circuits... no, I mean real hardware hacking.

Essentially, I've found a new interest in the core compiler that allows just
about any physical object to be made... the foundry and machine shop.  With
this, I can build tools, whether simple tools like hammers and saws, to more
complex machines like lathes and milling machines, that can allow the compiling
of materials to be made, such as panes of glass, boards, and ingots, and the
linking of them into the system of usefulness, such as windows, furniture, and
vehicles.

They may not be quite to the standard we enjoy today, but like computer tech,
why spend the money when you can just make use of what you have?  And why limit
hacking to computers and locks? :)

I purchased the first set of books to begin my study:

I've also found some interesting articles that offer some interesting ideas for
the creation of other stuff:

cool!

Have you checked out the build your own submachine gun books? :)

No, I'm afraid not.  At least not yet.

However, I have found a site that gives tons of technical specs, including
blueprints, for the Browning M1911 pistol... not to mention the full
instructions for building one.

Wow, that's neat!

Enjoy your endeavors, building things out of matter is a great experience, sorta
makes you feel like God or docta' Frankenstein :mrgreen:

Have you looked into CNC machines?  If not here's a couple links:

Not quite... I just think about all the things I could have once I have the
skill to make them, and I wonder why everyone doesn't come to the same
conclusion: If you can build everything you want, then you can have everything
you want... and not have to go to places like Wal-Mart to buy everything you
want... only to lose everything you want after discovering how shoddy they
really are.

I've considered CNC machines, but it seems like something of a cop-out from the
hands-on experience of operating manual machines... Kind of like learning Java
without first learning lower-level languages like Assembly; yes, it's doable,
but the results are inefficient, and bugs will be difficult to resolve without
knowledge of what happens at the lower levels.

Perhaps once I've found a workspace and built all the tools I need to fabricate
stuff manually, then I can get to work constructing the CNC machine for the
purpose of automation.

It's probably because of time restraints. If everyone was doing this, we'd all
be too busy surviving. Having factories and many things mass produced is pretty
much what distinguishes the industrial modern age from an age of everyone living
in mud huts.

@Cult: Yep, reteo is finally changing from anarcho-capitalist to an
anarcho-primitivist, nice choice :D

Heh. Perhaps. I am not talking about doing everything and making everything, but
having the ability to make much of the simpler things that do not require
advanced physics/engineering/electronics skill to produce.  This way, if
something is important to have, you don't have to worry about making ungodly
amounts of money to purchase it.  I mean, hell, $100 for a computer case?  The
damn thing is just bent metal, for crissakes!  $150 for a desk larger than a
milk crate and more stable than the cardboard box it came in?!  A tall filing
cabinet for $200?! There is no rocket science to making these things, why the
hell are they so expensive?!

Don't get me wrong.  I am a capitalist.  However, there is a difference between
being a capitalist and being a consumerist.  I don't buy stuff just to buy
stuff, and I don't agree with the consumerist bullshit that is being spoonfed to
the gullible.  If I can save money by learning to produce my own stuff, then I
have more money left over to buy the things I can't produce... such as computer
parts, car repairs, and higher-tech off-the-grid kind of stuff like solar cells,
wind-generators and batteries... which further allows for more money in my
pocket.  Now where in that is primitivist?

I just heard mud huts and squirted
