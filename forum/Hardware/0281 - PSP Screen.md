## PSP Screen
Posted by **HalfSight** on Wed August 13th, 2008 07:27:11 PM

I just got my PSP Screen in the mail. I can now repair my PSP and start playing
again, I am so excited. I ordered it from <http://www.echostore.com> I was
pretty surprised about how fast it arrived, but I guess thats why I paid an
extra $30. :D

I just got my soldering iron in the mail today, the ebay seller charged 14 bucks
for shipping, the iron is a WP-25 the auction started and ended at $.99

I just pro-sound modded (direct jack to sound out great for getting higher
output into the mixer) my Nintendo DMG-01 (the ol' gray brick gameboy) you can
get them on ebay for around 10 bucks including shipping if you're patient.

The new hardware is still too expensive, I think I'll wait until I'm 40 to start
messing around with current generation devices... until then I'll be happy with
my monochrome dot matrix display and 4-bit audio!

Nice!  I bought a PSP for my b-day in early July, and late July it got eaten by
a dog (pics soon).  Anyway, I bought another and uploaded some custom firmware
(CFW) and I love this thing!  I hope you have CFW on yours, otherwise you're
missing out on thee whole PSP experience.  If you haven't I got a Pandora's
Battery and would be more then willing to do it for ya.

I modded mine about a month after I got it. Right now I have the Dark-Alex
Release 4.01M33-2 running. All sorts of cool extras. I have like 600 nintendo
games on it and quite a few Super Nintendo and even N64. I am just having
trouble trying to figure out the portable VNC I installed. I think it has
something to do with the version.

If anybody knows anything let me know.

What N64 emulator are you using, I'm trying to get this
[Daedalus](http://pspslimhacks.com/psp-emulators/n64-emulator/) one working, but
I'm having tones of trouble.

Also, could you send me a link to that VNC client you're talking about?

Thanks!

Ok, so, its basically trial and error. I lucked out on the N64 thing. I
literally scoured the google tubes to find that one. You have to search
specifically for slim apps if you have a slim. I have the files if you want
them. I found the VNC thing in a haze the other night. no clue where I found
that one, just been lookin for a decent tutorial since. But the best spot I have
found for homebrew wares is
<http://dl.qj.net/Homebrew-Applications-PSP-/catid/112>

So give it a look and a search. and remember. most of this goes in the game
folder. not game150 or game3xx.

So like I said its just trial and error

Yeah, if you could send me the files, or a url where I can find them, that would
be wonderful!

Yeah I was pretty lucky! It's a nice iron too, it gets a just a little too hot
for my liking though, I'll upgrade to a nice solder station someday :!:

P.S. That's what happens when you charge an ungodly amount for shipping (the
package was postmarked $4.50) no one bids on your stuff!
