A bit about 411 in Verizon territory. Local information is free in metro Boston.
If you ask about a toll number, the op gives you the NPA(s) for that area. In
metro DC, the switch hook trick still works, at least on Fortresses.

I just finished the third instalment of
[Aiport Discovery](http://dualisanoob.com/phreak/scans/airport_discovery.scan.txt).
Fifteen aiports, 1500 numbers. grep for things like tones, cool... or elevator.
There's a screening number, an ATC number and a monitor number as well. Enjoy
them before they go away. Thanks to Zapper and sgnome for helping scan Sky
Harbor. And thanks to Zapper for naming the file.

If you want to hand scan, check out [handscan.net](http://www.handscan.net/). It
generates number lists and is NANPA and ATIS INC compliant.
