I'd just like to point out that this site 
does not satisfy my emotional, spiritual, social
or sexual needs.    Although I'm starting 
this topic in the trolling thread, it's 100% true.

Do you need a hug?

Yeah, but by that monkey in your sig.   He's friendly.

Also... the email notifications aren't working again.

If our society seems more nihilistic than that of previous eras, perhaps this is simply a sign of our maturity as a sentient species. As our collective consciousness expands beyond a crucial point, we are at last ready to accept life's fundamental truth: that life's only purpose is life itself.

Those should be back to in working order now.  Also, feel free to email me when there's a technical problem: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:phlak@phx2600.org">phlak@phx2600.org</a><!-- e -->

PS - This site doesn't seem to fill my sexual needs either.

Wait, what? You think an increase in nihilism is a sign of [i:rb06m9sm][b:rb06m9sm]maturity[/b:rb06m9sm]?![/i:rb06m9sm] [Rude_mocking_tone]HAH![/Rude_mocking_tone]

Begin with a function of arbitrary complexity. Feed it values, &quot;sense data&quot;. Then, take your result, square it, and feed it back into your original function, adding a new set of sense data. Continue to feed your results back into the original function ad infinitum. What do you have? The fundamental principle of human consciousness.

And yet your analogy absolutely RELIES on the presence of true and consistent (albeit not complete) systems that can be predicted and relied upon to infer new information that is just as true and consistent as the inputs. <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) --> 

Your reliance on such anti-nihilistic systems belies your immaturity  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->

I think, and my thoughts cross the barrier into the synapses of the machine - just as the good doctor intended. But what I cannot shake, and what hints at things to come, is that thoughts cross back. In my dreams the sensibility of the machine invades the periphery of my consciousness. Dark. Rigid. Cold. Alien. Evolution is at work here, but just what is evolving remains to be seen.
