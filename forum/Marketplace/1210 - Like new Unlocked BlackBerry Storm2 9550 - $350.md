**Details**

  * **Item** : BlackBerry Storm2 9550
  * **Condition** : 9/10
  * **Asking price** : $400
  * **Includes** : Everything that comes standard in the box, PLUS a charging
    cradle, a 1600mah extended battery and a pre-applied Zagg InvisibleShield
  * **Contact** : Email or DM me if interested

**Notes**

This phone is in pristine condition except for a few light scratches on the
battery cover that are hardly noticeable unless you're looking for them. I
applied the Zagg shield a few days after getting the phone and used a cheap VZW
screen cover until then so the screen is 100% scratch free.

What would be the right price?

Something close to the cost of a like-new Droid I suppose.  Or something more
then the phone is worth new.

Got me a Droid, updated post to selling instead of trading.
