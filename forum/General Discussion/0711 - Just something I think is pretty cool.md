Kind of unclear to me without looking at the site closer.  So all of those courses are available online through videos and downloaded texts?  It mentions terms, which implies you have to sign up/register.

claims there is no register or signup just has video lecture notes reading and what not each course seems to have different stuff maybe just depends on who posted it up 
cant get really anything but knowledge out of it but i like knowledge
the terms looks like its broken down into classes set up how it would be if you attended so lessons in term one then term two
