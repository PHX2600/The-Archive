I heard Mr.logic went or was going to go last year or something, Nak said he was
going to make it this year to listen to some funky electronic music (I really
don't get that stuff most of the time...)

That event is too huge now. I was glad to see Goldie, Dieselboy, and Lemon D
last time, but the packed crowd just makes me irritable now, I'm not going this
next time around, will just stick to local stuff.
