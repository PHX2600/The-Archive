## Finished version 2.0 of my audio driver

Even though it's 2.0, it's still very basic. But it works!

I posted the sources to:
<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://forums.parallax.com/forums/default.aspx?f=25&amp;m=393838">http://forums.parallax.com/forums/defau ... 5&amp;m=393838</a><!-- m -->

Even though the .spin files can be read in a text editor, I strongly recommend viewing it in the Propeller Tool (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.parallax.com/Portals/0/Downloads/sw/propeller/Setup-Propeller-Tool-v1.2.6.exe">http://www.parallax.com/Portals/0/Downl ... v1.2.6.exe</a><!-- m -->), text doesn't do the formatted alignment and color coding justice.

Here is a pdf of version 2.4, for the casual viewers that don't want to install the SDK (don't blame you):
[attachment=0:1njr9dtz]<!-- ia0 -->PCM 2.4.pdf<!-- ia0 -->[/attachment:1njr9dtz]

The first yellow blocks are &quot;constants&quot;
The first green block area is &quot;data.&quot; It is manually entered wave shapes in hex  <!-- s:o --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /><!-- s:o --> 
The peach block is all of the variable data
The blue block is all of the high level code and functions

...and the last green block is where all of the magic happens; the Assembly code  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->

The formatting (tabbing and whitespace) is a little odd at points, it doesn't look this way in the SDK, it's just how it &quot;printed&quot; to pdf.
