I moved the meeting location to Unlimited Coffee. Borders isn't going to meet the needs of our hacker gear. This coffee shop has a big black table in the middle, so I'm sure this will be nice. They also have icecream, yay.

first order of business: hacking the icecream. Or perhaps hacking the coffeepot. Anyone got a NetBSD cd?

They also have nice comfy looking couches, he is blatently ignoring this. He just likes that stupid table becasue he's a business man  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->

Indeed. A business man that ignores the couch but mentions the icecream...

If I can get the day off I would like to go to this meeting and maybe do a little bit on something Locksmith related. I can show advanced lock picking like Medeco and security Pin etc.. or maybe do a little bit on by-pass techniques? I am not sure what you guys have covered, but I do not want to be a total newb and just sitting there sipping an ice latte. Maybe show Marshall keys or Automotive by pass techniques etc.

Hey XlogicX,

how about a presentation on wireless mesh networking, like what's seen in the OLPC's. Specifically, the security aspects.

Lemme know if this is already-tread upon ground  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->  

PS where is the new meeting place located  <!-- s:?: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /><!-- s:?: -->

If nothing changes, Penguin and I will be showing up this Friday.  Can't wait to be there!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **ThatGuy** on Thu April 3rd, 2008 04:24:22 PM

I am going to try and make it to see what 2600 is all about. I live far west by the Cardinals stadium if anyone needs a ride I can stop along the way, feel free to send me a PM and I will give you my mobile number to arrange pick up.

Posted by **PHLAK** on Thu April 3rd, 2008 06:24:42 PM

Posting from Penguin's pad, where we just finished constructing a 3 foot tall Jacob's Ladder using copper tubing, pvc pipes, and Plexiglas.  What are the chances it would be alright to bring this thing to the meeting tomorrow?  We probably wont unless we think they wouldn't mind.

(Pics coming soon)

Posted by **Ugly** on Thu April 3rd, 2008 09:44:08 PM

I thought I played the Jacob's ladder thing out a while ago <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

I'll show up as I have a proposition for a build I'd like to run by everyone.

Posted by **nak** on Thu April 3rd, 2008 10:49:39 PM

I'm picking up a microkorg @ ~5pm so I might show up late or something

Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Thu April 3rd, 2008 10:54:45 PM

I want to hear about this build idea, I like builds...

Posted by **LosT** on Fri April 4th, 2008 10:21:13 AM

I've got some nice pics of an OLPC hack we did at ApacheCON-  

Once again, going to try and make it tonight- but have to prep my teams for the Avnet Tech Games (tomorrow morning)-

Did anyone else get the new Ti kits from the 430 day?
