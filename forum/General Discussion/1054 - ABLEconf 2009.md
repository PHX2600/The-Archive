Hey guys, I'm one of the organizers for a free-admission conference on using open-source software that is coming to UAT in October.  Anyway, I made a fancy press release, so here it is:

TEMPE, AZ – Building on the success of its first run last September, the Arizona Business &amp; Liberty Experience Conference (ABLEconf) is set to return to the University of Advancing Technology (UAT) on the 24th of October, 2009.

With businesses, schools, governments, non-profits and individuals all looking to cut costs wherever they can, open-source software can help leverage the advantage of using software in their infrastructure that delivers enterprise-ready results without the entanglements of costly licensing. 

Open source office application suites like OpenOffice.org can be leveraged to cut the repeating costs of paying for new office software and training, while implementing open standards that make it easy to do business with users of all variety of office software.

Firewall systems such as OpenBSD's pf can be used to implement industry-proven network security at the fraction of the cost of firewall systems with high licensing and support costs.

Operating systems such as GNU/Linux and its Ubuntu distribution can be used to create reliable, secure desktop systems impervious to viruses and malware that are highly customizable to an individual company or school's needs, entail no licensing costs, and require less frequent hardware upgrades than proprietary systems such as Windows and Mac OS X.

These, and many more topics will be presented and discussed.  Thanks to sponsors like RD Harris PC and our host, UAT, admission is free. No registration is required to attend.

ABLEconf was founded in 2008 by a coalition of open-source software groups and associations in Arizona.  The free-admission one-day conference hosts a wide variety of speaking tracks and sessions on how to take advantage of open source software in small business, government, medical, enterprise, and individual use.

Interested.

But is it a technical conference, or a business one? The press release thingy kind of makes it sound like a non-technical conference. Which would be far less interesting.

Its a technical conference, but the application of the technology will be presented with more of a business context in mind, so the talks will mostly talk about tech used for solving issues like getting Winders/Mac/*nix boxes all sharing files with each other, for example.  The tracks will be fairly diverse too; We're aiming to have stuff that relates to govt, non-profit, and medical operations too this year.
