## Is it really wise to use sites like Facebook and Google?
Posted by **Valveritas** on Thu August 4th, 2011 01:01:45 PM

Here's a wonderful quote from Randi Zuckerberg, sister of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg: "I think anonymity on the Internet has to go away. People behave a lot better when they have their real names down. ... I think people hide behind anonymity and they feel like they can say whatever they want behind closed doors."   Yeah, and then when everyone knows who you are anyone can stalk your every move.  What a great fucking idea!  God forbid we' be allowed to CHOOSE what information we give to people we talk to.

Haven't looked into it deeply myself, but Google definitely has CIA's hands all over it.

And "anonymous" is just another front for the CIA  <!-- s8-) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /><!-- s8-) -->

What gives you that idea?

You might start with googling "CIA google" or "DARPA google" or "NSA Google" as there's quite a bit of material out there.  Other than that, I'll have to get back to you on something specific that might make you go "hmmm".

I would say that since the NSA has the backbones tapped (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/06/21/att_nsa/">http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/06/21/att_nsa/</a><!-- m -->), posting on FB/MS/G+ doesn't make any difference.

Yes, if your talking on the Internet (or just about anything electronic) assume your talking to the public. Even if it's private now, it may not be when policies shift (even momentarily). Even if it's encrypted and sent to an acquaintance, it really depends on who the acquaintance wants to divulge to. If it can be digitally recorded, it's public, treat it that way....unfortunately.

Not really anything to add,  but speaking the guy who mods the SE forum, I would extend this to include anything you say to people, too. Pretty much always assume if you let information out of your head, it is now in the public domain. Sounds kind of Orwellian, but I'm serious in that if there's anything you really don't want anyone to know about, don't communicate it to anyone. O_o;;

I violently agree <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

I agree, but we shouldn't be complacent about it.  We should demand certain levels of privacy, especially when there is absolutely no legitimate reason for a company or government to know personal details about our lives.

Agreed. and I don't think our philosophies are inconsistent. demand the best prepare for the worst kind of a thing. We're saying not to have 100% expectation of privacy, but in demanding privacy; there comes a difference in having 2% of your dox dropped vs. 50% of your dox dropped. I prefer less of my dox to be dropped, hence using https, tunneled ssh proxy and many other things. But demanding privacy from an entity like facebook, and even seeing them comply, only makes me gain a little respect for them in-the-moment, but I still wouldn't trust important data/communication on the line with how fickle companies can be with changing policies.

I may not be articulating very well either, even proof reading what I said confuses me. I would use an anal-ogy of taking a crap in a public restroom. I don't want others to watch me do it, but if they really wanted to, they could find ways to get away with it. It's knowing what's possible, but still demanding a solid non see through stall with hopefully no surveillance cameras (all of which are reasonable requests). Not complacent, but still not 100% expecting complete privacy.

Not to sound pessimistic, but I'm not sure demanding that the US Government stop illegally spying on the people will get you very far.

lol, yeah. We can't expect the complete privacy package, but we can request parts of it

I really don't see the point of NOT placing demands upon the government, since after all, government only has authority through consent of the governed.  If you consent to privacy invasions, that's what you'll get.

I think "expect the worst, hope for the best" says it right -- fight for safeguards that prevent the collection and inevitable misuse of private/personal data, but in the meantime do your part and don't drop your own d0x. E.g.: "Pretty sure FaceSpace shouldn't be requiring a home address / SSN to make an account, but I don't see how they're going to verify I don't live at Burger King". ^_-.

And ArchAngel just touched upon one of the more important data protection methods; misinformation. If you poison the information cache, they still have information, but now it's unreliable. If all the information is unreliable, you have to throw much of it out.

At the same time, cross-referencing and correlation are pretty powerful ways to validate some of the unknown.

Regarding misinformation: [quote="XlogicX":22xcj1cm]cross-referencing and correlation are pretty powerful ways to validate some of the unknown.[/quote:22xcj1cm]Adopt a habit of being consistently inconsistent? Could help make those cross-references confirm the misinformation and it's easier to remember what is true from your end.

Yep. Did I not already sound the alarm about Google being unsafe?  Lol.
