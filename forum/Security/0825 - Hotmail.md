## Hotmail
Posted by **TheGodfather** on Tue June 9th, 2009 08:27:28 PM

I am suspect of an employee of mine leaking confidential informaton to a rival company.  Any help on getting into his personal hotmail account to verify this? 

Let me know if there is anyone willing to help me out on this.  I'm still fairly new at the game and it would take me too long to figure out.  If you are interested in helping me out please contact me at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:jsmith85251@gmail.com">jsmith85251@gmail.com</a><!-- e --> 

Thanks!

If you are real, setup a keylogger on his box at work. Then do a barrel roll.

best advice i could give is contact your it dept to monitor his traffic and he he isnt doing from work contact  your companies legal representation as he could commiting a serious crime and if you obtain proof (by say hacking into his account) you may lose important evidence to convict or sue for damages 
i know its not the 1337 hacker way but it prolly is your best bet to cover you and your businesses ass

Terror Drone, 

Thanks for the advise.  I allready had my IT guy check the system and we found some evidense but not enough to fire the individual.  Prosecuting the individual isn't anything I'm really interested in as it will end up costing alot of time and money with the attorneys.  

I just need to find out for sure or not.  

If anyone can help me get into the email acct it would definately help solve my problems.  Even willing to pay.  This specific employee works mostly in the field so putting a key logger on his pc isn't an option either.  

I guess I should go out and find some barrels to roll then huh?

Please don't post on this board asking for help &quot;hacking&quot; into someones email/facebook/computer/network/etc.  Consider this a warning.

Please research the definition of a hacker (vs a cracker) before making any more posts.... then do a barrel roll!
