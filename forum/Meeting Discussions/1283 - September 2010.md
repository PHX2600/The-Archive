Hey, I have a copy of RHEL server edition on cd, and I'd like to trade it for some knowledge. I will give this cd (well actually it's a dvd but whatever) to anyone who can help me understand sql injections or xss, as I cannot manage to figure these things out on my own. Although I know that you could just as easily use CentOS or Fedora, a genuine copy of RHEL is relatively difficult to get, so if you want it for the novelty value i would love to learn this stuff. After all it doesn't cost anything to teach me this. Honestly, I would probably let you borrow the cd if you really wanted RHEL, but if you want to keep the cd this is the only way ill give it up! 

I'll be at the meeting if anyone's interested.

What version? Six will be out soon.

Does it have a subscription key with it? or a redhat.com login?

Nope, no subscription key or anything, so you won't be able to get any updates. Like I said there really isn't any technical advantage of having this instead of CentOS, except that you get to use &quot;real&quot; redhat. It is version 5.4, and version 5.5 came out a little while ago. I will also let you use my Redhat Academy login if you want, as long as you wont fuck anything up (I use it for school), so you can learn some cool things for Linux from there.

I am pretty much a Linux nub, maybe I could learn some things.

There sure are a lot of ubuntu users here, I wonder why.

Also, I really enjoyed the meeting! I felt a little bad for not knowing as much as the rest of the people there about technical stuff, and I had a terrible soar throat, but I am already looking forward to next month <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->

don't feel bad we are not those type of people everyone has different skills set and level they bring its what makes the collective pool work if we were all experts at everything it would make for poor conversation
