## Tucson meeting?
Posted by **metlotter** on Wed November 7th, 2012 10:26:56 PM

Hey, I apologize if this is the wrong place to post this. I'm just trying to get the word out that we're trying to start a new 2600 meeting in Tucson. Our first meeting will be Friday, Dec 7th, at Revolutionary Grounds (on the patio if it isn't cold), at 7 pm. 

Carry on...

This is great.  I know of some people that live in Tucson that used to go to our meetings, maybe they'll be interested.  Good luck!

The holidays and some illnesses threw us off for a bit, but we'll plan on doing another one Friday, Feb 1 at 7 pm. Revolutionary Grounds again, I suppose.

Well, as it turns out Rev. Grounds has an improv comedy thing that requires all of their chairs on the first Friday of each month, so we moved our group (of two) elsewhere. Future meetings will be at Shot in the Dark.
