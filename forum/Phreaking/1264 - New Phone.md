## New Phone
Posted by **Medicine Storm** on Thu July 8th, 2010 11:53:00 AM

A friend of ours seeks a new phone/provider. We don't know phones that well. We
love our droid, but this friend doesn't need THAT much awesome.

The phone should be capable of:

  * some texting, not necessarily unlimited, but cheap is good.
  * some limited internet usage,
  * phone calls.
  * provider must not be evil-empire. (or, as least evil as possible.)

Cost is higher priority than hackworthy. Friend is not much of a phreaker.

affordable service cost is higher priority than affordable phone cost, but both
are to be considered.

cool-factor is a consideration, but not as much as cost. A $400 phone bill is
not cool.

Needs a decision by the 15th of July at the latest.

Suggestions?

If cost is top priority I'd have him look into Sprint.  They seem to offer the
most features (unlimited mobile to mobile, unlimited text, unlimited internet,
etc.) for the cheapest prices.  As for the hardware, pretty much any dumb phone
will suffice for his needs as described by you.
