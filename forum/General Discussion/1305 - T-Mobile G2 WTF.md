## T-Mobile G2 WTF!
Posted by **ThatGuy** on Mon October 18th, 2010 01:27:43 AM

I picked up a couple T-Mobile G2's a few days prior to the release date. I have had them now for a couple weeks. OMG what a POS, the both of them have so many problems and bugs. They are running Android 2.2, and it is buggy as all hell. All kinds of random problems dropped calls, no GPS, signal fluctuation while in the same location. The phone locks up, sending MMS pictures is buggy etc, etc, etc. The Pros is that when it works it is fast as hell and the new 4G is sweet. Talked to tech support and got to talk several other specialist for 2 hours about all of my problems and bugs. Seems like frequent reboots, and pulling the battery are required to keep it running smooth until the update comes out. Buyer Beware!

Wait for the G2 to get rooted and CyanogenMod to be available on the device.  Best custom ROM out there.  Also, I don't think there's 4G in Phoenix yet.

The tech support people said I was getting 4G, and the guy who sold me the phone said my phone got 4G. He even did a speed test with 3 other phones with a youtube video. It is crazy fast compared to my iPhone and my wifes old Blackberry. The people in the store said Phoenix is one of the few cities with 4G right now. He said it had just started recently here. They did mention that it was called HSPA+, and my phone has the little H symbol at the top almost 98% of the time. It does go to E in certain areas outside of the city. The T-Mobile site is also showing that Phoenix is live for 4G/HSPA+ coverage  [url:3b1itqq6]http&#58;//t-mobile-coverage&#46;t-mobile&#46;com/hspa-mobile-broadband#[/url:3b1itqq6] scroll down to the bottom of the page and check out the map.

LOL, no disrespect meant. Its just like the 10th time someone told me we don't have 4G in Arizona yet. I don't know if its real 4G but that is what T-Mobile is calling it. Web pages, Google maps, you tube, Pandora, e-mail pictures, etc load super fast now compared to before.

Did a little research, and technically I was correct, Phoenix doesn't have 4G yet.  What the G2/T-mobile have is HSPA+, which is an extension of T-mobiles 3rd generation (3G) network.  However, the speeds attainable on HSPA+ are comparable to those attainable on Sprints true 4G network.  As I understand it though HSPA+ will be difficult, if not impossible, to upgrade and extend to compete with LTE (Verizon and AT&amp;T's 4G network technology).

Sounds right to me , seems like a marketing ploy to keep up with competition. Maybe because 4G sounds cooler than HSPA+

My thoughts exactly.  Just use some buzzwords to sell the products.  Surprised they didn't mention how &quot;green&quot; it is or anything about the &quot;cloud&quot;.

No, but it's carbohydrate free.
