Let's get this one started early.  Any ideas on what's going down yet?

I will do my best to have something to present this time, i just got servo control working via the telnet server and I'm working on interactive web controls now.

I'm experiencing an issue with the file system though, maybe someone who is better at Embedded C than me could take a look and see whats up, when I refresh a page several times in a short amount of time the file system fails and starts reporting the file pointer as &quot;NULL&quot; and labeling files as not found, my current thought is that refreshing so quickly leaves some files open because they are still loading when I hit refresh, but I'm not positive.

I'm going to bring a few shirts to give away.

Also, we should look into doing a round of pecha kucha's sometime.

Syx lists his location as &quot;Avondale&quot; in his profile.

I think he's the person who called Unlimited last month. I spoke to him.

Unfortunately Syx you couldn't live farther from me <!-- s:-( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:-( --> I'm in North Phoenix in the exact opposite direction.

Are you on the twitter?

I told rax and phlak I would be doing a presentation on command execution in open source applications. I plan on making this presentation into a white paper and trying to go to HOPE or something similar with it. If it sucks, then I'll just fall on my web shells paper. 

Rax will be providing a projector.

Like stated before, I will be going over command execution vulns. I will cover a number of open source packages and point out their vulnerabilities. I haven't reported them yet either, so go nuts and hack some sites with the knowledge (free 0dayz OMG).
