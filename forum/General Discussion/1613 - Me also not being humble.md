## Me also not being humble

Dudes! I got accepted to talk at both Defcon and Hope!!! So epic!

I'll be talking about Nova ([url:3a569vez]https&#58;//github&#46;com/DataSoft/Nova[/url:3a569vez]) and network anti-reconnaissance generally. For those who were there, it will be similar to the BSides talk I gave. But more epic. At Defcon, I'll be doing a 20 time slot talk on Thursday. But Hope is one of their regular slots. 

With Logic also doing a Hope talk, the Phx2600 will have good representation around the conference circuit this year!

Now I'll have to think about going again this year.

Great work guys, but honestly I heard they were accepting any talks that weren't just rehashes of previous years material.  <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

Hey ALTF4, what time/room slot did you get?

I got 4pm on Sunday in the &quot;Dennis&quot; room, not sure how to take that...&quot;Dennis,&quot; I wonder what the reference is. Last time it was easier names like Tesla, Babbage, and Lovelace (Or something like that).

nice, this guy is elite.

I just listened to the last ep of Off The Hook. Likely hackers that have committed suicide, on the context of things. I should have been more sensitive, I suck.

So, even if you create a widely used programming language, you'll barely be remembered in the media?

Thanks guys!!

1) HOPE rooms are named after &quot;famous persons who have demonstrated the hacker spirit.&quot;

3) For Defcon, I'll be in Track 4 on Friday at 3:00pm. (Though I think technically they haven't released the defcon schedule yet. So this could possibly be changed, however unlikely.)

4) Logic: oh, no! That's a late time slot on Sunday. I think I might be on a plane / in the airport by then. I dunno, I'll see. I really want to see your talk.

I beleive I go on at 4pm, if you can't make it, it's ok; I'll make sure to pick up the video.

I hate that your slot is the same as the Autism one, I will have to purchase the video for the autism talk, because it looks really interesting. There are actually a lot of slots where there are 2 or more really interesting talks going on at the same time, guess it can't be avoided.
