## intro

Hi everyone,

Just wanted to introduce myself.  I've been into electronics from the days of 300 baud modems and 8088s. I've been running my own automotive related electronics/software business since 2001. I'm currently consulting for a company developing hybrid vehicle propulsion systems and in the process of building a prototype vehicle for them as well as designing schematics and circuit boards for them.

I've found that a lot of the "tech" people in the valley are really "software" people. Theres more to tech than the latest rails-based startup! I want to connect with people interested in hardware design.

I started CollabLab which was a coworking space in North Phoenix.  I moved my office and could no longer host the space, but before I started, I was looking into starting a TechShop type place. (<!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.techshop.ws">www.techshop.ws</a><!-- w -->)  I see there is a group of people looking to start a "hackerspace" in Mesa which is great, but just way too far. I'm in way north phoenix.

I'm also into CNC (have a mini-mill CNC conversion).

I hope to make it to the next meeting.

-Mike
