## SODIMMS
Posted by **RetroTech1541** on Mon March 2nd, 2009 01:35:16 AM

I've got this laptop and I read the manual and it was supposed to take 2 128mb
modules to make a 256mb system. So I ordered new from Kingston.com using their
memory selector but then the laptop won't fire up with them in (any
combination). So if anybody can use 128MB SODIMMs, I've got two that I'll part
with for $15 each as/is (they're prolly good.)
