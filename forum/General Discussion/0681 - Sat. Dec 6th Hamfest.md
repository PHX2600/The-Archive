Well I just got back, kicked ass.

Got an ICOM T7H dual band handy talkie for 80 bucks! retails for about 190!

got a delta link router for 5 bucks! sells at radioshack for 40-60 bucks

and some other cool things too parts and whatnot.

As per usual the vendors were all awesome and I had a lot of good conversations and saw a ton of crazy electronics that I didn't even know existed.

Any one else make it out?

Create a new post for the next one in Scottsdale you told me about.  See if we can get more people to go.  Maybe carpool if necessary.
