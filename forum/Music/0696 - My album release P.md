Eternity at the Zoo forever!!

Word Problems.  Ha ha...yes... looks like you took my advice to have the
computer give the wrong answer. :P

Nice tunes.  You'd probably be killer on a synth keyboard thingy. ;) I think you
may have surpassed your instrument.  Heh.

The first 9 tracks are done on 100% grey gameboy running LSDJ, a tracker program
by some cool guy.

10 was made using a speak and math toy, reason and ableton live

11 was LSDJ + reason

12 same

13 my LSDJ cartridge memory got corrupted and that's what happened when I tried
to play a song
