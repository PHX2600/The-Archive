## Non-profit looking for website assistance
Posted by **homewardbound2012** on Mon April 9th, 2012 03:57:03 PM

I work for Homeward Bound (a non-profit based in Phoenix) and am in charge of the new website we have just created.  I am learning Wordpress as I go but would love some help from a student who is looking for some side work....

A few of the issues I am working on at the moment:
1) Hyperlinking a footer image
2) The possibility of creating a staff intranet site through our existing site 
3) Creating pop up windows of information instead of navigating off our site when a link is clicked.

If you are interested and knowledgeable about Wordpress, please email me at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:m.buckley@homewardboundaz.org">m.buckley@homewardboundaz.org</a><!-- e -->

Thanks!
