## Innactive User Cleanup
Posted by **PHLAK** on Sun August 16th, 2009 04:02:11 PM

Just went through and deleted any accounts older than ~90 days with 0 posts and
deactivated any older than ~60 days with 0 posts.  If there were any legitimate
accounts among these I apologize and encourage you to re-register/reactivate
accordingly and make a post or two to prevent further pruning to your account.

If there are any further questions/concerns, or you're having a problem
reactivating your account, please email me at <phlak@phx2600.org>
