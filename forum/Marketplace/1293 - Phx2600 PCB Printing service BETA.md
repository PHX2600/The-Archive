## Phx2600 PCB Printing service BETA
Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Mon September 13th, 2010 10:06:03 AM

Not sure if there is a demand for this kind of thing but I find myself sitting on top of a large amount of PCB creation materials and with only my own projects to print I'm afraid some of the more degradable materials will go bad before I have a chance to use them up.

So you supply me with a to scale image or an eagle cad file and I'll slap that sucker on a brand spanking new piece of copper clad PCB for you.

Not really sure about pricing, I guess I would just want to cover my costs which would mostly be the copper clad and the etchant (which I recycle anyway)

I have attached some design rules for eagle which I prefer are used, You're welcome to use your own rules but I can't guarantee anything smaller than 8mil. I have done 5 and 6 mill successfully but I don't want to push it.

I can print any design, even just text or images. See below for some examples of prior art.

You're welcome to try and contact me on the forums but a quicker way would be to email me directly,

Especially if you're including eagle files or something.
