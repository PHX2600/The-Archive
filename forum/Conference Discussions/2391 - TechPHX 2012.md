## TechPHX 2012
Posted by **twitterkilo** on Sat November 3rd, 2012 05:14:22 PM

What is TechPHX? An "unconference" that focus on educating people on their
abilities to create content for online distribution (blogging/video/podcasts),
sharing tips and tricks; and having that face to face interaction with people
going through the same challenges you are.

Why should I go to TechPHX? To help maintain your status of "IT Overlord" among
family and friends.

Even though "content creation and online distribution" isn't the same as
"coding, security, and social engineering" they both share a
"Disruption/Anarchist/Anti-Establishment" slant.

Particulars:

Schedule of talks: <http://techphx.com/schedule/>

It's in the part of town where the I-10 and the US 60 intersect, just West of
the Fry's electronics; East of Baseline and 48th ST in the University of
Advancing Technology <http://www.uat.edu/>

Saturday November 10th 8am-4pm Sunday November 11th 9am-Noon

Cost: Free. If you only wanted to show up for 1 talk and you knew the room it
was in, you could just walk all the way into the room, sit through the talk, ask
questions, and walk out after it's over, and no one would hassle you with "Hey
where's your badge?". However registration is free, and we'd love to have you
listed just for headcount (feel free to use fake info, but please only register
once). <http://techphx.com/register/>
