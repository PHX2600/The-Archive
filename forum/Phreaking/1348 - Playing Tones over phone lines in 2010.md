## Playing Tones over phone lines in 2010

Does anyone know of any potential legal issues of using the disconnected
recording or any other phone system tones as a voicemail greeting?

No, but I wouldn't worry about it... but that's just me, it's not like "ma bell"
is the RIAA... or am I way too naive?

I read a story in the recent PLA book where a dude setup a pay phone "please
deposit 25 cents" recording on his voice-mail and confused the phone company
pretty good when some old lady called his voice mail and then called the phone
company looking for answers.

That was a while back though.
