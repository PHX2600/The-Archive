Not sure how many people know about this but if you are using a smart phone on
the AT&T network there is a little trick to get at least half off and tethering
for your phone.

First you have to have AT&T (Duh)

Second you need a generic GSM sell phone with an intact IMEI number (Preferred
it be an AT&T phone so you can put the sim card in but I did this with a
T-Mobile phone also and didnt seem to matter on there end)

Third Take out of the Smart Phone

Now call up AT&T and tell them you got a new phone and no longer have your old
one. They will ask you what phone it is and what the IMEI is. Comply and have
them take off Internet if you are paying for Smart Phone Internet (Usually cost
$30 a month)

Then ask them to add MediaNet Unlmited (This should cost you $15 a month) If you
are on a Family plan ask for Family Plan MediaNet Unlimited it should cost only
$10 a month.

Now you are done with AT&T plug your Sim card back in to your Smart Phone and
test your internet. It should still work with out any issues.

If there are any issues you can input the login info manually to gain access

    Password: CINGULAR1 (PAY ATTENTION TO UPPER CASE)

Now I can confirm this works for Windows Mobile Phones, I am not sure about
blackberrys and iPhone's should work as long as they are JailBroken.
