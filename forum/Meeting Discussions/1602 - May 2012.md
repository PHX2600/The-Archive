Soooo... where are we meeting and can we do presentations? I've got a cool little presentation on the power of nonsexual touch that I think you guys will dig.

We're going to be meeting at Citizen (aka Lola's) one more time (May), as we were not able to lock down a new location in time for this meeting. So their &quot;no presentations&quot; policy will apply. <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( -->

What about at the pub we went to after the last meeting?  Their back room was big enough for a presentation.

If not, we never really clarified if it's the presentations per-se, or the projecting on the wall that they don't like. We could always test their limits by bringing in a large LCD and presenting from that. Or just do a crappy huddle. But Rosies doesn't sound too bad either.

One crappy thing about Rosies is that they expect large groups to only do a 1-check thing, they seemed upset that we all wanted to do separate checks last time. Even though they allowed it, that could get a little awkward maybe. Otherwise, the place is perfect.

I'm down with a monitor to present on, or Rosie's.. whatever.

Anyone have a miniDisplay -&gt; vga cable?
