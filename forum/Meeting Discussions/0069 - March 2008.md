Ok, looks like ill actually have this meeting off work! 

Any ideas yet?

I have most of  the makings for about 8 BEAM style solar engines and the parts I dont have could be scavenged or generously donated, (I think Nak has some nice broken solar cells <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P --> ). I have the 1381IC and the NPN Transistors as well as about 5 Diodes, assuming I could get Nak to donate solar cells we would just need some storage caps ( about 4700uF) and some smaller ones (about .47uF) I think these parts could be scavenged fairly easily.

So if anyones interested in that stuff I could bring it along to the next meet. Thinking back though im not sure Borders appreciated soldering irons... so this might not work out.

I do have solar cells, but if we want to keep Border's as a meeting place no soldering would be a good idea.

I have been looking into chemiluminescence (glow stick innards / Luminol) as a replacement for LEDs in the glow balloons.  I can't seem to find a source for (di)Phenyl oxalate ester, online or otherwise, YET.

We should start a MAKE meet-up group, I think the solar project maybe more appropriate for that  <!-- s:idea: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /><!-- s:idea: -->

Entertaining idea for sure! and watch out for the high purity H2O2 in those glow sticks, its pretty nasty.

Ah it's not too bad, I've put it in my mouth before without much consequence  <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( -->  but it's more like what HAVEN'T I put in my mouth.

The high concentration of h2o2 could be harmful to the latex though...

I think I meant instructables meet-up, either way same thing.

Yes, Tilden's boys (Solarbotics) make some cool stuff.  The different solar engines have many uses-

I can get ass-tons of parts if you want to do a build.  

Last time I was at a meeting that we did soldering nobody bothered us- but it probably isn't a good idea...

Breadboarding fine-

It sucks we can't do that kind of stuff at borders, i mean i understand from their point of view. Dual suggested this one place on 7th st and glendale called Unlimited Coffee. It would be kind of short notice but someone could check it out and see if it's worth it. can't be any worse than borders.

I'm down. Oh and I'll be there this time for those who missed me  <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> 

I swear I've been hacking every thing I touch. Even video games. Ever use jansport backpacks? I was looking at mine in the corner of my living room, and it hit me "hack em", so within an hour, I dropped their DB. Then I flip on the TV, and see this visit Oklahoma commercial, so I hop on google, and hack the crap out of Oklahoma, taking out a school district and getting a shell on university of Oklahoma in one night. 

Lately Dre doesn't want to hang out, so I get bored. If anyone else is as bored as me, lets hang out.

This first step is to admit you have a problem, and then seek the necessary professional help.

You can hang out with me, but... I'm not planning on going to another meeting - unless someone wants to give me a ride (this way I can ensure I won't be there by myself).

Yeah, I lack a ride too. I've got gas/booze money though, so if someone feels like picking me up from my place (just into sun city) I'm there too.

PS: I drank a glowstick once and I was fine. Bad cramps, but I'm still here.

PS: If I come, I'll bring my JTAG and laptop. Anyone that has a surfboard 5100 or surfboard 5101 cable modem, I can uncap them for you. SB5120s are a bitch and a half and I've never successfully uncapped one, so, you guys w/ surfboard 5120s from cox are shit outta luck.

It looks like I am working until 7:30 on Friday :'(

Posted by **PHLAK** on Thu March 6th, 2008 10:11:20 PM

I recently Ebay'd a 5100 and uncapped it, I love the 1.5MB up, I don't know how I ever lived w/o it!

Ok, IMHO (or Not so HO) Borders has to go as a meeting place.

It was OK as a goof for January, but, it's not really that conducive to the meeting vibe that I've grown to know and love. And the WiFi is spendy.

How about we move from Borders (after a few folks get there), to this "Unlimited Coffee" place?

Just spoof an authenticated MAC, no need to pay. If the router double checks for double assosiation, use airtun. No need to assosiate.

Posted by **LosT** on Fri March 7th, 2008 02:07:16 PM

I am going to try and make it- and will hopefully be bringing the parts for my wearcomp I'm building.  Still getting used to the display though....

Very true...

One could also do [url=http://thomer.com/howtos/nstx.html:1pwjldsy]IP over DNS>, but it's a pain.

So uh... you can uncap cable modems?  Does this only work with certain models?  I thought cox controlled the upstream somehow...

I don't have a surfboard, it's scientific atlanta (I hear they're pretty crappy).
