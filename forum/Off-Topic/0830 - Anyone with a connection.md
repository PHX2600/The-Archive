## Anyone with a connection?

Hey, I'd like to something nice for someone and I need someone with a connection to a sports console game developer. My sister's son is 17 and he excels at sports games, he also plays high school b-ball and may not be a hacker but he can use a computer just fine. Anyway, his dad was a big sports fan and read all the papers and almanacs and Kenny (my nephew ) inherited that love of stats. His PS2 and 360 rosters are updated as quick as ESPN breaks news. He loves navigating the menus updating his sports sims. He does a better job than whoever does it for x-box live and psn, seriously, he finds errors and omissions whenever those updates come out. I told him not to be so harsh on the games, the rosters are probably done by unpaid interns. He says he should be the one doing it and he'd do it for free or at his expense. He was serious too.

 So I mean, does anybody know anyone that could help hook him up with an interview or a phone call or anything?

I would just contact the game development studios directly that do these games, show him his work, and they may very well want to hire him based off that... as a playtester or some such. I don't think you can really 'gift' such a thing though.
