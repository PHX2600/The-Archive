## Lookin 4 logik

I'm looking for a totally sweet digital logic simulator, something that can do all the standard gates, latches, flip-flops, and multiplexers, anything else is bonus but those things are the minimum.

I have found a few on the Google but they are pretty mediocre and look like they may have been programmed in VB. 

Thanks for being my personal search database.

I second Ugly's remark. Maybe this is because we have both used the same product in school, however, it was still an excellent educational experience, hence why they used them at our school.
