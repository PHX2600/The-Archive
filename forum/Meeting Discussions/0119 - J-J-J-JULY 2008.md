Last meeting before Defcon, who's going, and what's going down?  I will do everything I possibly can to make it to this meeting!

EDIT:  I just realized this meeting is on the 4th. :'-(  I promised my fiance that we'd do fireworks up in Cave Creek this year, so IDK if I'll be able to make it.  I'll see what I can do though.

I will not make this meeting. Might be a small crowd since it falls on a holiday. Maybe moving it to another day or week would be better? Is the place even going to be open?

I agree, less the fireworks and more the pain in the ass it is to go and ACTUALLY SEE the fireworks, however, I have to work that Friday, so it turn out I'm letting my fiance down as well as all you guys... sorry.

I will try to be there.  The fireworks show at Tempe town lake is pricier and more crowded than ever anyway...

Coincidently, Evil1 gave me some fireworks which I have in my truck...  <!-- s:twisted: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><!-- s:twisted: -->

I'm pretty sure I'll be hanging with family 'n' stuff for the 4th of July, so I doubt I'd make it.
I for one wouldn't mind moving the meeting to next week.

No meeting today.

I just called Unlimited Coffee and they had just closed when I called. Nobody called in for the meeting today, so its assumed there is no meeting. However, if anybody wants to get together for an impromptu meeting, say tomorrow or next friday, let a brother know  <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

If people are willing to go, I will swing by Saturday or next Friday. I have a few new tools and locks to show off.
