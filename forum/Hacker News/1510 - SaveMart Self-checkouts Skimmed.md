Lucky Supermarkets Confirms Tampered Credit/Debit Card Readers Resulted inCompromised Account Information

Modesto, Calif., December 5, 2011 – This afternoon Lucky Supermarkets confirmed that several employee bank accounts had been compromised due to the tampered credit/debit card readersin the self-checkout terminals. There have been approximately 80 employee and customer reports of either compromised account data or attempts to access account data, with the majority coming over this past weekend.

In a Consumer Advisory on November 23, 20 stores were originally communicated as having tampered card readers and consumer notices were posted. However, three additional storeshad card readers replaced prior to November 23 but were missed on the original report sent to the company’s Asset Protection team. The missed stores were Lucky- Sunnyvale, Lucky-Novato, and Lucky on 939 Lakeville Hwy. in Petaluma. Again, these were not newly tampered card readers but part of the original discovery.

We strongly recommend our customers who used a self check-out lane in the affected stores contact their financial institution to close existing accounts and seek further advice. We continue to work with local, state, and federal law enforcement to find those responsible.New Consumer Notices are being posted at all our Bay Area stores.

Listed below are the affected stores:

Lucky- Pinole

Lucky- Milpitas

Lucky- Mountain View

Lucky- Redwood City

Lucky- El Cerrito

Lucky- Daily City

Lucky- Foster City

Lucky- San Carlos

Lucky- Millbrae

Lucky- Alameda

Lucky- Sunnyvale

Lucky- Novato

Lucky – Union City

Lucky- Santa Clara on 234 Saratoga Ave.

Lucky- San Francisco on 1515 Sloat Blvd.

Lucky- Hayward on 25151 Santa Clara St.

Lucky- Fremont on 5000 Mowry Ave. and 35820 Fremont Blvd.

Lucky- Petaluma on 939 Lakeville Hwy. Petaluma

Lucky- San Jose on 5510 Monterey Highway, 200 El Paseo De Saratoga, 844 Blossom HillRd., and 3270 South White Road

Lucky Supermarkets will continue to do everything we can to keep our shoppers informed onthis important issue. We have a Consumer Alert button on the homepage of our websites where we are updating Frequently Asked Questions and posting any new Consumer Notices.We encourage customers to contact our Customer Support Center at 800-692-5710 with any report of fraudulent activity or attempted activity to their accounts.

Would be interesting to know how they traced this back to the self-checkout registers ... also, &lt;3 the use of tampered as an adjective. *grinz*

Ouch. The thing I hate about a skimmer is that they are hard to detect. Many ATM's, self-checkouts, gas pumps, etc.. are built modular, so they already look suspicious in their default state. The only self defense I can think of is to grab it and make sure it doesn't come off easily (which is far from foolproof), and also make sure the one your using doesn't look different than the other ones in the area (unless there is only one of them, or they are all skimmed).

Any other self-defense ideas out there? My techniques suck. I guess I'm at-least always looking for them though.

Without sarcasm -- the best defense is probably to just pay for things in cash. ^_-.

While I totally agree with this, it's just not practical in the world of today.  This did, however, get me thinking about things like Google Wallet and how they have the ability to change things for the better.  While I don't know the ins and outs of Wallet I believe, using the NFC capabilities of our phones and the security and verification provided by Google, there's a huge potential to be a highly secure form of digital payments.  The only problem here lies in your trust of the provider of said technology.
