Hey guys,

I'm selling my GP2X F-200.  Its lightly used, in great condition with few
scratches and includes:

  * The F-200 itself.
  * Carrying case
  * Stylus
  * 4GB Micro SD card w/ SD card adapter preloaded with Genesis, NES, SNES, and
    other emulators and things that rhyme with NOMS. ;)
  * USB SD card reader

Here's some pics comparing the size of the GP2X with a DS and iPod Touch
(neither included in sale):

Its a great device to hack around with.  The olde school gaming community has
ported games like Quake II and Descent II to the GP2X platform and there's a lot
of codecs and things to make it a decent PMP.

I can bring it to the next HeatSync Labs meeting or PHX2600 meeting if make it
this time.
