## Sunday Funtime

So I went by my cousins and helped him fix his LCD screen on his SIlverstone case. He has had this thing for about a year and we had a few troubles. First the LCD started smoking. This was bad so we just got it put together and vowed to fix it another day. Well 6 months later his ATI HS4850 card was overheating his box so he got a nVidia 9500GT lopro to replace it. So, we got the LCD hooked up without any smoke, but it was just on, no indication that it was doing anything. So, once again we slapped it together and vowed that we would tackle it again. 

So we got it apart and fixed the LCD, we have all seen the inside of a computer, but here is the inside of his silverstone case.
