I'm looking at window film for the fast approaching summer and happened upon 3M's [url=http&#58;//solutions&#46;3m&#46;com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/WF/3MWindowFilms/:vn3u4msl]site[/url:vn3u4msl]. And looky what I found:

[quote:vn3u4msl]3M Window Films are designed to:
...
prevent injury from glass fragments due to crime,
destructive weather and [b:vn3u4msl]terrorism[/b:vn3u4msl][/quote:vn3u4msl]

Are you kidding me!? 3M is using fear to sell [i:vn3u4msl]window film[/i:vn3u4msl]!? This is the stupidest nation ever.

Hmm, interesting... I should try that sales technique at radioshack.

&quot;Have you upgraded your cellphone? If not the terrorists will get you when you are sleeping!&quot;

Some terrorist plot -- like the plan is to go around breaking all the unprotected windows in America to spread their message of dissent? Damn terror hooligans! 

They'll probably steal the paper, too -- that is, unless you buy 3M double-sided adhesive tape to fix your media firmly to the porch. Of course, that prevents reading, but over the weeks you'll have a sturdy bunker of recycled newsprint to shield yourself from the unAmerican threat.
