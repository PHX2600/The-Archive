## BinRev  * OWNED *
Posted by **Rax** on Tue July 28th, 2009 09:43:09 PM

BinRev.com has been owned.  See Stank's post about it [http://binrevstatus.blogspot.com/](here).

See the article about it (and other shit) at this [http://www.leetupload.com/zf05.txt](urber leetzor magazine).  Since it's a text file, you'll need to scroll down to (and / or search for) ```Binary revolution ``` (with the lower case "R").

The authors were even so kind as to attempt a password hash crack.  I'm pretty sure I didn't put "dick" for my password. It would have been something more like "Ihaveareallybigdick" or something. LOL

At any rate, Stank is saying that he may just retire the entire site (see first link). Can't say that I blame him.

I get a 404 on that text file.

The text file is back online.  It makes some interesting (albeit long) reading. They basically captured the entire session as they owned each box.

Just got a look at that text file,

Pretty interesting read.

Some harsh words at the end, If it was me I would feel pretty defeated seeing this.

A decision to retire the site would suck but I understand.

I use to see, and made text file logs like these in the pre-internet days.  Funny how some things haven't changed - including the smack talk.

I might have to rethink my need for PHP.

Interesting.
Did they somehow get root or did your user have root privileges?   Something looks misconfigured!
I also archived a copy of the section (found it in google cache)  [http://nrezinorn.net/binrev.txt](here)

Also the PHP code they are referring to?  the backup scripts?  Were they mad you didn't use bash or something?   <!-- s:roll: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><!-- s:roll: -->
