## Internet Jukebox

So I was at the AMF bowling alley north of Shea on 32nd street, and shortly before I had to leave was browsing songs on their touch screen, internet jukebox (Nak will know which one I'm talking about).  I found a song I liked (something by Daft Punk), and clicked it once... nothing happened... I clicked it a few more times... still nothing.  So, out of sheer pointlessness, I started clicking the song as fast as it would let me (tapping the screen real fast).  After 5 or 6 rapid clicks, the play button appeared on the right.  I clicked this and it brought up a message saying something along the lines of "For an extra credit we can play this song next." and had a "No Thanks" button at the bottom.  (From prior experience, had there been a credit in the machine there would have also been an "Accept" button).  Anyway, I'm not sure if this actually worked, or not, I had to leave immediately after adding a number of songs this way.  I don't know the brand of the machine, but I'm hoping to go back soon and get some pics/vids, experiment some more, and hopefully, verify that it worked.

We've got one of these at the bar by my house.

Are you thinking that when it asks you that question, it's already put the song at the end of the play queue?

A few weeks ago I put money into the machine and played a song with it.  The machine did the exact same thing then as it did this time, popped up the "Extra credit" window.  Therefore, my assumption is that it was working as if I had inserted some moneys into it, even though I had not.
