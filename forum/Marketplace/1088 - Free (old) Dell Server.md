## Free (old) Dell Server

Free to a good home. Or a reasonably good home. Hell, free to anyone who wants
to do something with it other than just chuck it in the trash. LOL

Dell 2600 Server (ID FF0SD31) -- Look it up at [Dell's](http://bit.ly/4vXzIB)
site to see the specs.

This is an old server that was pulled (in working condition) from a client. I've
wiped the data and re-initialized the RAID 5 on the unit.

Direct message me (or if you've got my docs, contact me directly) if your
interested.

Sold!

Wait, how is it "sold" if there's no price on it!

Gone!
