I guess malvertizing has gotten really bad lately. Good thing those of us use
things like NoScript and Adblock. To me it's all malvertizing, they may not be
trying to hack your computer, but if that's the case, they're still trying to
hack your brain.

Favourite quote from source article:

> "It's clear that validating the ads everyone depends on is a shared
> responsibility. If consumers don't trust ads, they may not go to the site, or
> they'll start running ad blockers, and that will compromise everyone's
> ability to monetize."
