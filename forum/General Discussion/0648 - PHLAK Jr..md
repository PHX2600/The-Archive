I knew it, people would get jealous of David and have to start up their own baby factories!

What kind of world are we going to leave to our children... THINK ABOUT THAT.

OMG LOL I came in to post, "She wanted one of her own after trying to take mine a few times." 

Congrats man! How do you know it's a boy?

We don't know it's a boy yet, but I felt better referring to it as "him" rather than "it".  In fact, I want a girl.

Oh cool. Have any names picked out or considered?

If it's a girl we're going with Kaylee Elizabeth.  If it's a boy we're not certain, but pretty set on Jacob for the first name.  We need some suggestions for boy middle names, got any?

Yeah, we'll probably start teaching him to goose step after the first week or so.

I, too, extend my congratulations. I wonder if you'll start your son or daughter on Mac OSX, Windows, Linux or something else...maybe VTech or Leapfrog.

Also, a good middle name for a Jacob might be Bradley. ("Jacob Bradley, get in here and finish your homework.")

Well, I've got 2 windows boxes currently set up and my laptop is Windows/Ubuntu dual boot, but now that you mention it, it might be a good idea to start my child out on Linux.  At the very least I will be teaching him both.

Also, thanks for the name suggestions, however we've decided to go with Matthew Ryan if it's a boy.  We find out the sex of the kid this week, I'll let everyone know when I find out!

I certainly agree.  Start him off right; Windows is trivial and ubiquitous enough that he can switch over later if he wants, and have it down in a few hours...  and probably start chafing in a few days. <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->
