## January's meeting
Posted by **JPerridew** on Wed December 24th, 2008 10:53:01 AM

Weeeeee - I plan on being there!  It's so great being on spring break. ^-^

If anyone is willing to help me with with using a boot disk for OS's that would be greatly appreciated.  I plan on stealing my wife's lappy and bringing my already-burned discs..  If anyone could help, is there anything else I should consider bringing?

I'll be there.  Bringing my BlackBerry Storm, woot!

@JPerridew What exactly are you trying to do with boot disks?

Well, honestly... just trying to figure out why they won't work.  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D --> 
I've got a copy of Ubuntu that I found an install file on.. when I use that, it automatically gives it a spot in the OS selection screen pre-windows booting.  That particular OS works on the lappy, but is RAM intensive.
I've got... gawd, several others - but I must be doing something wrong.  With or without the Nero (v6) boot loader I can't get morphix, DSL, gnoppix (sp).. and I think a couple of others.  To work! Sux.  My box only has 128MB RAM (PC1) and has problems running Winblows XP - which is why I'm trying to switch.


Anywho - be there this Friday.  I plan on bringing a few pictures from my Caribbean cruise of phones that I ran into.  I'm also going to bring my removable HDD with the copies of OS's and some discs to burn.

Sorry for not showing up, I guess I've just been to busy getting caught up in other activities.  I'll stick around on these forums probably, but I think my last meeting is going to be whenever I attended last  <!-- s:!: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /><!-- s:!: -->

Kool, I usually bring my camera, but a tripod would be nice.  It would be pretty leet if you wrote a script that took pictures every 5 minutes or so and we could see how the meeting progressed.

We were in Illinois. Actually we were on the train coming home. I already promised Mattie we'd make February. I hope it was fun!
