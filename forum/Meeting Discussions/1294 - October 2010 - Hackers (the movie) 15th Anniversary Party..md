## October 2010 - Hackers (the movie) 15th Anniversary Party.
Posted by **PHLAK** on Fri September 17th, 2010 01:46:28 PM

It has been brought to my attention that this coming October 2nd marks the 15th anniversary of Hackers the movie.  Seeing as the October meeting falls on the 1st, I am declaring this meeting the official [b:3jhan7hi]Hackers (the movie) 15th Anniversary Party[/b:3jhan7hi].

As such, I would like to find a way for us to play the movie for the group at this meeting.  I own the movie on DVD so I will be able to provide that, I know Rax has a projector and would hope he is able to provide that this meeting.  Anyone can use their laptop or if someone would like to, they can bring an actual DVD player to be used (if you do, talk to Rax in regards to the type of input the projector uses).  What I'm unsure of is location.  We're currently planning on meeting at Mama Java's, though I have a few questions:

[list:3jhan7hi][*:3jhan7hi]Do they have a wall or way we can hang our &quot;screen&quot;?[/*:m:3jhan7hi]
[*:3jhan7hi]Do they have readily available power outlets for our equipment.[/*:m:3jhan7hi]
[*:3jhan7hi]Will they mind us playing a copyrighted movie in their establishment?[/*:m:3jhan7hi]
[*:3jhan7hi]If something wont work with them does anyone have a proposed alternative?[/*:m:3jhan7hi][/list:u:3jhan7hi]

I would really like to see this come together.  If anyone has any recommendations/ideas that may help, please speak up.  In the event this does happen, my plan would be to start the meeting at 6pm as usual and start the movie around 7pm, allowing people to get there on time.  Let me know what you think.

We could rent out a theatre with our membership dues.

Oh wait.

Lets see,

I could arrange for a classroom with built in projector and screen at polytech.

Kind of far but would be sweeeet.

Might be able to lock something down at empe campus which is closer.

But no one on tempe owes me any favours yet.

I'd be willing to drive out to Polytech for one meeting to guarantee a good viewing.  If others are fine with this and you can secure a room, I'm in.

Poly is a go.

We can meet in Peralta Hall 201.

It has seating for 30+ a built in projector and screen.

Also has a computer at every seat which you're welcome to use as long as you don't fuck em up.

I already promised the professor we wouldn't break anything.

Unless there is major outcry against this, or someone comes up with something better, this will be our October meeting location.  [b:274lr9so]Meeting will start at 6pm as usual and we'll start the movie around 7pm.[/b:274lr9so]

Also, is it okay to bring food/drinks here?  Was thinking people could bring in snacks (chips, crackers, soda, etc.) if that's allowed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Fri September 17th, 2010 03:58:19 PM

I don't mind if you bring food but if it gets on anything your head will roll.

Also we could tour some of the campus facilities possibly while we are out there.

Almost forgot, what about parking?  Is there somewhere specific to park or will there be one or more apparent free parking areas?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **TerrorDrone** on Fri September 17th, 2010 07:21:10 PM

i live fairly close to polytech about 10 minutes away actually so if limited parking is an issue people can come to my house park here(have room for maybe 4 or 5 cars) and we can carpool over there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **PHLAK** on Fri September 17th, 2010 07:38:59 PM

I'm willing to pick someone up if they're on the way.  I'll be coming from Central &amp; Thomas so if you're between there and Polytech and need a ride, let me know.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Sat September 18th, 2010 04:59:58 PM

After 5 I don't think parking and transit does any checks.

should be safe to park in the main lot.

Also if you're not affiliated with ASU then they cant do anything to you anyway.

Posted by **AltF4** on Sun September 19th, 2010 09:37:06 AM

I used to rollerblade all over campus at ASU. Sometimes the people in the MU didn't like it, but whatever. 

I'm totally down for movie night.

And I have &quot;Freedom Downtime&quot; (on VHS, though).

Then there's &quot;Hackers 2&quot; the fictionalized Mitnick story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **AltF4** on Wed September 29th, 2010 08:13:33 AM

Freedom Downtime was really good. Perhaps longer than it needed to be, but effective.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Wed September 29th, 2010 09:00:43 AM

Bring em all.

We can stay until they kick us out.

Just wanted to thank all of you for your hospitality and I hope to meet more of you next month with my transition from Chicago to Phoenix. Hopefully I'll see some of you at Toorcon in San Diego later on this month!

Yes,

Thanks to everyone who showed up.

A good time was had by all.
