## PSP Screen
Posted by **HalfSight** on Wed August 13th, 2008 07:27:11 PM

I just got my PSP Screen in the mail. I can now repair my PSP and start playing again, I am so excited. I ordered it from [url:2hh4prze]http&#58;//www&#46;echostore&#46;com[/url:2hh4prze] I was pretty surprised about how fast it arrived, but I guess thats why I paid an extra $30.  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->

I just got my soldering iron in the mail today, the ebay seller charged 14 bucks for shipping, the iron is a WP-25 the auction started and ended at $.99

I just pro-sound modded (direct jack to sound out great for getting higher output into the mixer) my Nintendo DMG-01 (the ol' gray brick gameboy) you can get them on ebay for around 10 bucks including shipping if you're patient.

The new hardware is still too expensive, I think I'll wait until I'm 40 to start messing around with current generation devices... until then I'll be happy with my monochrome dot matrix display and 4-bit audio!

Nice!  I bought a PSP for my b-day in early July, and late July it got eaten by a dog (pics soon).  Anyway, I bought another and uploaded some custom firmware (CFW) and I love this thing!  I hope you have CFW on yours, otherwise you're missing out on thee whole PSP experience.  If you haven't I got a Pandora's Battery and would be more then willing to do it for ya.

I modded mine about a month after I got it. Right now I have the Dark-Alex Release 4.01M33-2 running. All sorts of cool extras. I have like 600 nintendo games on it and quite a few Super Nintendo and even N64. I am just having trouble trying to figure out the portable VNC I installed. I think it has something to do with the version.

If anybody knows anything let me know.

What N64 emulator are you using, I'm trying to get this [url=http&#58;//pspslimhacks&#46;com/psp-emulators/n64-emulator/:2jbaax86]Daedalus[/url:2jbaax86] one working, but I'm having tones of trouble.

Also, could you send me a link to that VNC client you're talking about?

Thanks!

Ok, so, its basically trial and error. I lucked out on the N64 thing. I literally scoured the google tubes to find that one. You have to search specifically for slim apps if you have a slim. I have the files if you want them. I found the VNC thing in a haze the other night. no clue where I found that one, just been lookin for a decent tutorial since. But the best spot I have found for homebrew wares is [url:2zvx5jkb]http&#58;//dl&#46;qj&#46;net/Homebrew-Applications-PSP-/catid/112[/url:2zvx5jkb]

So give it a look and a search. and remember. most of this goes in the game folder. not game150 or game3xx.

So like I said its just trial and error

Yeah, if you could send me the files, or a url where I can find them, that would be wonderful!

Yeah I was pretty lucky! It's a nice iron too, it gets a just a little too hot for my liking though, I'll upgrade to a nice solder station someday <!-- s:!: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /><!-- s:!: --> 

P.S. That's what happens when you charge an ungodly amount for shipping (the package was postmarked $4.50) no one bids on your stuff!
