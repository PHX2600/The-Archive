I like the walls, the rules, the steel bars, they make me feel safe.

It has been a year since I have been restricted to here. Think I could have
"troll" status removed, please? Thanks.

BTW, I verified that the "Unlimited Coffee" cafe will be open until midnight on
Friday the 3rd, 2009. They close at 4pm on Independence Day though.
