Yea well, I hope you guys are having fun in Vegas (bastards, I'm sitting at home cleaning out the fridge).   

I will however be going again this year though to the Phoenix Tech-Security Conference  <!-- s:o --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /><!-- s:o -->  (Thursday, August  14th,   8:15AM - 4:00PM at Desert Willow Conference Center).  You can sign up for a free entry pass online, if anyone cares I can post the link I got.  You can probably get in for free just walking up anyway though.  Lots of vendors showing up but no products looking terribly interesting, and in general it's a pretty corny affair just walking in seeing a bunch of suits try to powersell on eachother.

The only reason I go is because I like to make fun of the salesmen who have no idea what their product actually does, and possibly get free swag/usb sticks/lunch.  If anyone else feels like going, hit me up and I'll see if we can crash it together.  On a side note, if you sign up online for a ticket use a junk email account because all the vendors will most certainly spam the fuck out of you looking for business.

In other news, been a while since I showed up to a 2[55,60]0 meet or even looked at this site.  Damn sweet design by the way, mad props to those who put hours.
