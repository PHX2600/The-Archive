## Shipwrecks!

This is pretty h0tt -- I'd love to go crawling around in the remains of an empty ship sometime. Not quite &quot;urban&quot; exploration, but great big empty places nonetheless:

Anybody have any experiences with sunken or beached ships?

That'd be a crazy experience. And for some reason I'd want Steven Segal to go with me...
