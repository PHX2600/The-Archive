Nak: The GhettoPanel Project
Nak: Very nice
Peng: yeah
Peng: fight the power
Peng: by creating your own

Forums been pretty silent lately so I thought I would post some Original Content to get it going, Ive been making a small solar panel out of broken cells in my free time (pics below) anyone else have any experience building home made power generating devices? wind, solar, etc?

HUGE VERSION=[url:3sk6cgse]http&#58;//blastwavelabs&#46;com/Media/Uploads/26panel&#46;jpg[/url:3sk6cgse]

More details... 
I got the broken cells from the Electronic Goldmine for about 10 dollars, there are 12 cells in one strand, each cell generates .5 Volt and the Current varies with the size of the cell. There are 48 cells total generating 24 volts in series but you can combine the 6 volt strands in any kind of arrangement to get more current if desired.

Again... very nice  <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> 

I wonder if you could spray it with some sort of transparent epoxy or resin to get it waterproofed?  Something that wouldn't discolor in the beautiful Arizonan sun.

Do you have any intent on mounting those to a board or another large surface?

They are mounted, to that MDF board they are on top of there... in the picture... look again maybe <!-- s:?: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /><!-- s:?: --> .

But yeah they are mounted to that board with a Terminal on each end (bolt) hopefully soon I can get some standoffs and a piece of nice plexi or glass and make a cover for it. Without a cover its not safe to really use outside.

I just came into some old solar panels and was wondering what to do with them myself.

We have lived on solar power since 1988, but there is not much that needs to be said about the panels themselves. You just hook them up. diodes are needed. if the broken panels don't still have diodes attached, we recommend wiring in a few ... at least every couple of shards. a clear, waterproof spray coating is a good idea. A lot of the stuff that says it won't be affected by the sun also filters UV. Don't get the stuff that filters UV... for obvious reasons.
