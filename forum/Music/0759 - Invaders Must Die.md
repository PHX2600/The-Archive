## Invaders Must Die
Posted by **XlogicX** on Mon March 2nd, 2009 12:54:46 AM

the Prodigy put out a new album. For anyone who follows them, it sounds more
like the first two albums than anything, which is a good thing in my opinion.
Thinking about cruising over to London to check out part of the tour (around
summer time).

The Prodigy was what got me into electronica to begin with.  Good to hear
they're still producing.  Loved their first 3 CD's, especially Fat of the Land.
I pretty much hated Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned.  Will check this one
out.

I didn't care much for Always Outnumbered, Never Out gunned either. My favorite
album was Music for the Jilted Generation though.

It's official, 2 out of 2 hackers approve of Invaders Must Die.  I've listened
through it twice now, and first impressions are good.  At this moment I would
rate it "leaps and bounds better than Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned", and
just slightly worse than the other three albums (but not bad at all).

Two out of two!! That's a majority! ACTUALLY THAT'S 100%

MAN, Democracy is BAD-ASS! NOW, because we've been conditioned (OR MAYBE ITS THE
UNBREAKABLE GENETIC PROGRAMMING) to be fucking sheep (boner) it WOULD HAVE BEEN
likely that no one would say anything negative about prodigy or whatever
invaders must die is.

BUT WAIT, CHECK THIS OUT:

Now that this asshole (ME!) stirred the pot (I'm not saying anything positive or
negative, just being a dick in a hole [uh oh]) someone else WOULD BE MORE LIKELY
TO EXPRESS A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW.

:ugeek: LOOK AT MY FACE, DO I LOOK LIKE I'M KIDDING? :lol:

lol, you need to take more lessons from jargon if you want to get this troll
thing down correctly. :)
