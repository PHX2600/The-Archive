## Trolling forum
Posted by **XlogicX** on Wed April 16th, 2008 12:34:25 AM

One of the members that has been banned a few times in the old forums just
registered, if you have not noticed. I have created the trolling forum to
accommodate him, instead of banning again (just trying to be fair). Check out my
post in that forum to get details of how it works if you're curious.

I don't know the history of this user or how incorrigible they are,  but I think
what you're doing is actually tantamount to banning.  It's just one step removed
from it.  But I suppose it's better than a full banning as they still have some
ability to voice themselves.

I will say this for anybody that has not been around long enough for the history
on the issue, because I would like you all to know the history (without having
to experience it too much):

  1. Go to the old forums (link is at bottom of current forums)
  2. Go to the Trash forum (forum is at bottom of old forums)
  3. Randomly sample through the posts there, you will quickly begin to notice
     the flood of posts that turned people away from the forums (I actually had
     people request to have their accounts deleted to be disassociated with the
     forums that hosted this person, some of these people were very valuable to
     the community as well).

I believe in freedom of speech, but it sucks when the forums are flooded with
enough crap to completely torch our reputation. I know these words still sound
harsh and ignorant to some, which is why I insist you go to the old Trash forums
and see for yourself.

I did what you suggested.  I couldn't make much sense of those posts.  Reading
them was sort of painful.  I'm not sure it was trolling or just spam.  I've seen
forums where there are probably 20 jargons, and I wouldn't care to see that
here.

Anyway, based on what I see, I trust your judgement.

He's off the drugs which caused alot of that drivel. He's also on better meds.
Still, this guy won't get a job and has no life, so he's online 24/7 and still
wants to be a part of 2600 even tho he knows he's kinda unwanted. He's still a
jerk and isn't that against the rules? There's a no being an asshole rule right?

He has provided us such a grey area situation. I believe it is best to include
everyone, but he has demonstrated the cost of that ideal. I kept him around far
longer than others would have preferred before he was originally banned. The
troll forum is my attempt at balance, to give him a voice, but just under the
point of pushing others away. Good to hear he is getting a little more sane.
Hope he gets himself a job. And at best, if his posts show improvement in sanity
and lack of BS, then we can possibly allow him more frequency of posts, although
not necessarily a complete un-ban. I also think that the increased frequency
should be held to a vote each time the idea comes up. But he still needs to calm
down for a bit. I know the guy is fairly sane and intelligent deep down...and I
guess that is the side we would like to see.

I for one think if he shows improvement we should give him more leeway, but
based upon past experiences, I don't feel that the current restrictions are in
any way excessive.

Can't you see we are all energy beings separated from the universe and one
another by our brain's left hemisphere? Can't we all just... get along? :lol:
