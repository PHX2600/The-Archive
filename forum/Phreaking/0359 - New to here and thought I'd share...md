Hi, I'm new here and, well, I'm not sure if this is the right section of the
forum but... I came across [this](http://www.citizenengineer.com/).

It debuted at this years HOPE.

Now to get my hands on an old pay phone...

Welcome analogSpoook, this would be the correct forum. Don't worry, if it's not,
one of us will just move it to the right one...or not even realize it's in the
wrong place. I remember something about the citizen engineer thing, but I didn't
get to see their talk, too many talks, too little time. It is almost impossible
to even see a third of them live :(

lots of pay phones are being decomishioned  due to the surge of cell phone us
and the cost of maintianing them as they no longer pull in the money they used
too so finding one for sale is not to hard found a few on ebay with starting
bids @ 99cents and 45 bucks s+h
