## Article series pointer: Build a text adventure engine.
Posted by **RetroTech1541** on Tue July 29th, 2008 02:37:27 AM

Hey guys. I'm very interested in building games but modern games, like the kinda you'd see on xbox 360, are large scale projects that can swamp even large teams. Still, when I was a kid, I promised myself I'd create a text adventure, everyone has seen one right? Well, to rival my best friend jargon, instead of hardcoding one text adventure, I'm building a text adventure engine in portable C, a language i've always been fond of. As I do it, I post articles journaling the process. Have a look if you feel so inclined, games is a knowledge game too. The series should be completed entirely this month.

Good luck with that!  I'm always interested in to see how games can be built up from scratch.  Interesting journal, very comprehensive.  I'll have to give it a closer look sometime.

Thanks for the luck. Your product is really shiny and polished and great, so I don't know if you fit in with the intended audience. All I've got is a shaky but workable design (having a design before you bang something out it always a plus) and it is kind of fun to chronicle the project's development. I'm hoping I'll get a search engine hit from a random person who wants to know how to build a retro infocom style game. After the completion of the article series I'm going to write a lengthier paper that will be easier to understand.

Cheers!

Something that I find to be a motivating factor is to do something that hasn't been done before, even if is something small.  Not only will it keep your interest up, but others will be more interested in it and more willing to test the end product.   Other than that, just doing everything you set out to do.  There will definitely be times when you get bored or frustrated - which can be the most challenging part sometimes.  

I ran across a site awhile back, that has many small C programs, with the goal of making a game.  I think you might find it of use.

Well, I don't know if you are interested in using existing tools to make your games, but the [url=http&#58;//www&#46;inform-fiction&#46;org:2tkz4cj3]Inform Language[/url:2tkz4cj3] is designed to take a special form of source code, and compile it into modules that will run in any Z-Code (read: [url=http&#58;//en&#46;wikipedia&#46;org/wiki/Infocom:2tkz4cj3]Infocom[/url:2tkz4cj3]) interpreter.

I toyed with the idea of this and also of a mud, but haven't had the real determination to see it through.  Good luck, though.  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->
