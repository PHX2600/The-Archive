[quote:279vurq4]The following words in your search query were ignored because they are too common words: [b:279vurq4]python[/b:279vurq4].
You must specify at least one word to search for. Each word must consist of at least 3 characters and must not contain more than 14 characters excluding wildcards.[/quote:279vurq4]

Unfortunately the PHPBB search is pretty lame.  Try using the search box at the top right of the page, it uses Google which, while not perfect, is substantially better.  Example: [url=http&#58;//www&#46;phx2600&#46;org/search/?cx=partner-pub-2614997598856289%3A81nadhhmes4&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=python&amp;sa=#728:2wppej1y]search for &quot;python&quot;[/url:2wppej1y]

Ah, but that still doesn't list all the Python code posted here.  <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->  At least, I don't think it does... I remember there being more.

Probably true.  I haven't come up with a good search solution yet, short of writing my own search functionality, but that would take time I do not have.

Wouldn't it be possible to change the behavior of PHPBB not to exclude a term like 'python'?  That would probably the easiest fix, I'd think.

I think it must be a conspiracy of the python haters because you also cant attach .py files to forum posts, wtf.
