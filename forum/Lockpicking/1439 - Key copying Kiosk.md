## Key copying Kiosk

I believe that is what I just saw when I went to Fry's Electronics. It was
automated; nobody to tell you that you can't copy that bump key. I didn't look
too closely, but looked like kwikset. I'll have to revisit soon; didn't have my
bump keys on me

Wow that's pretty epic,

The one near priest and the 60?

Maybe it sets off secret hacker alarms if it detects bump keys.
