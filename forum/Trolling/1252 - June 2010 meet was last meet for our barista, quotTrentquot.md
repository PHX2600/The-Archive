## June 2010 meet was last meet for our barista, "Trent"
Posted by **jargon** on Fri June 11th, 2010 12:30:03 AM

Trent at Unlimited Coffee was the barista that always worked during phx2600
meet-ups.

His last two nights of work at UC was June 4th and 5th 2010. (First Friday and
Saturday)

He decided to quit his job there in-order to find a new job that had better pay.

Best wishes to Trent at his new job. He will be missed. :mrgreen:

As-always, be sure to tip the barista that is on duty at Unlimited Coffee during
our meets.

My suggested tip for First Fridays to the barista at Unlimited Coffee is 1.00
per gourmet coffee or gelato, or .50 to 1.00 per depression coffee or fountain
soda initial fill.

Cheers, Keal
