## Request For Comments: EAP-Oasis
Posted by **AltF4** on Mon January 3rd, 2011 04:53:37 PM

So I graduated last May with my masters, and was rather disenfranchised with the whole scholarly paper publication system. I want to publish my Master's thesis online, but I need some peer review. The title is "EAP - Oasis: A Cryptographic Protocol for Open and Secure Wi-Fi Internet Access". 

So pretty much it's a link layer encryption protocol that you'd use on an open Wi-Fi instead of WPA or (gasp!) WEP. 

I would really appreciate it if any of you would take the time to read through it and provide comments in the form of improvements, typos, security flaws, formatting, layout, tone, insults, and/or abuse. Significant help will receive a mention on the acknowledgement page, and the eternal glory bestowed therein. 

Currently, the document is fairly polished, except that I need to redo the Implementation section because I have to redo the implementation! :p Currently I've only got this terrible POC thing which just barely works. So more on that to come.

You should see both a ODT and PDF version. If there are any problems viewing the docs, do let me know. Or if you have a better place to store the docs other than on Google, also let me know.

EDIT: Totally forgot to say: I'm hoping to post the final version of the paper on Arxiv.org, but you need an existing member or two to vouch for you before you can post there. Does anyone happen to know someone on Arxiv?

I shall read and offer my assistance.  Can't promise it will happen immediately, though I'll do my best to do so by Friday.
