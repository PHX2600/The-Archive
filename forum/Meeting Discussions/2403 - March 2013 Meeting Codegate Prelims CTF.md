## March 2013 Meeting: Codegate Prelims CTF
Posted by **AltF4** on Fri February 22nd, 2013 04:52:33 PM

This is a &quot;Day and a Half&quot; event running from (If I've done my time conversion right) March 1st 5:00AM to March 2nd 5:00 PM. The event is being run from South Korea, hence the odd times.

The March meeting happens to be right in the middle of the CTF, so we'll be playing it then. If HeatSync won't be busy before 5PM on Saturday the 2nd, we may do another meeting then.

One nice thing about Codegate is that they tell you the categories beforehand! There will be 100-500 level challenges for each of:
&quot;Vulnerability, Binary, Web, Forensic, Misc&quot;

So you web guys should have some more to do this time around. You get a category all for yourself. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

Ths event sounds great! I hope the challenges are a little less confusing than the last ones.
