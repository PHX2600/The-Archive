## Tech schools
Posted by **TerrorDrone** on Fri September 26th, 2008 09:08:08 PM

Now that my Cert  classes are over I have been looking in to going back to work on another degree 
been looking at tech schools for an BS in EE but not to sure. Has anyone gone to one (ie. ITT, Devry) and if so was it worth your time and monies.

I have a friend who is going to ITT tech (he's there right now) if I remember right it's about 40k US dollars
I went to community college and got a degree in computer networking for a lot less than that.
I don't know what kind of education well paying jobs are asking for.
I don't even know if the US dollar is going to be worth anything a year from now.
PHLAK went to devry.  My grandpa liked the engineers from devry, said he knew a couple damn good engies from there.

I wouldn't go to a tech school personally, but hey what do I know?!

I graduated from DeVry University last February and, while the tuition was kinda steep, I don't think it's much more in total than a typical 4 year university (ASU, U of A, etc...).  Also, I felt that (the majority of) my education was higher than I'd receive elsewhere, though all I have to compare it with is friends descriptions of their classes.  All in all, most of my core class teachers were very knowledgeable, while my general ed classes were taught by no one better than any of my high school teachers.

Bottom line, if you're easily bored of typical teachers trying to teach and are up for a challenge in your core studies, a tech school is probably for you.  However, if you're not the hardest worker, or don't pay attention well, a CC or typical 4 year university might better suit you.

I'd say it depends on the tech school.  I'd rank UAT just as high as I would any 4-year college, however, ITT Tech, well, not as much.  DeVry has been on the decline for a while now, and their basically squandering their tarnishing reputation for as long as they can until they can completely transform into a UoP knockoff.  After graduating from DeVry, I did have a small, but decent network of older DeVry alumni to forge connections with.  I got mixed views of the school's reputation from co-workers, half saying it was a challenging, fast-paced school, while the other half regarding it as an assembly line of rushed and incomplete education.  ITT/UoP/WIU were pretty much informly regarded as diploma mills everywhere I've worked, though.  Then there's Westwood College, where you can learn to program games with a controller.

I honestly do think Google has a filter in their job applicant queue against DeVry in particular.  Not a single person I know to have graduated from DeVry has ever even made it to a phone interview with them.

Went to Devry for the BS in computer engineering, compared to the masters degree I completed earlier this year, the Devry one was hard as fuck, but in a really good way. Oh, and now I am going to community college for an AA in Music Theory/Composition, woohoo. Really, as long as I can afford it, I will never stop going to school.

As far as a recommendation for Devry, it depends. I don't regret it for the knowledge and skills I got from there. I great baseline to explore everything else. But if you're getting the degree to get a high paying job, it's a start, but it really only would play into 5% of your job landings. Fortunately, I don't really care about that too much.

First understand the difference and transfer ability of regional credits versus national credits. Then you also should consider CLEP and DANTES exams. Another thing you may want to look into TD is that the GI bill has changed and in August they are offering E-5 BAH along side with regular TA as before. I am not sure what would make one qualify but it is worth looking into with the recent changes. I know that people out recently will qualify if they have not dipped into there resources yet.

I went to High-Tech Institute. I liked it and it helped me succeed at a lot of things and helped me get a job where I can play video games all night. I think that one is called Anthem College now though. I have taken a couple classes towards my BSIT but this college shit is way harder. I learned a lot. It was a good experience and the degree got me a lot of jobs.

As long as you're not going to the Univerisity of Phoenix I think you're fine.  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

I used to work there. Logic, our site admin has degrees from there and works there as well.....

One benefit of working there is free school, but it's pretty expensive normally.  I know a someone who works there and goes to school there full time for free.  He is studying to be a software developer and completed his associates degree in 7 months, start to finish, and now he says he'll have his BA in 1 1/2 years.  Call me crazy, but how can someone with absolutely no programming experience earn a Bachelor's degree that fast and really know what the heck they are doing?  He seems more focused on saying he has a degree rather than the quality of education.  I'm not saying everyone is like that, but it's no secret that many people use UoP as the fast-road to a degree and therefore many employers have a skewed opinion about the person's abilities.   <!-- s:? --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><!-- s:? -->

I have one degree from there. And as far as my endorsement of the school; probably not. It's not becuase I think the quality of education is low, it's just more an issue of value to me. Where (Value) = ((quality of education) + .5 * (Reputation of School)) / (Price)

Quality of Education:
In any case (for me), quality of education for many topics is up to the student, I feel I learned a lot because I chose to read all of my texts (of which I understood), and apply myself, regardless of my surroundings. I learn at the same rate at any school whether the instructor is good or not. Really, I depend on a good textbook, of which I can get other ones on related topics anyway.

Reputation:
Yep, UoP has some crappy reputation. Not all for the right reasons, but some of the things I have heard are true. Although, some people are way off on other stuff.

Price:
Way too expensive.

So UoP fails my equation. So why did I go there? I only had to pay for text materials. As price approaches 0, Total value reaches infinite. Yeah, I know it's kind of an exaggeration, but this whole formula thing shouldn't be taken too seriously anyway (kind of bored here).


Now that I'm looking for an education that UoP doesn't offer (music theory), I'm going to Mesa Community College (to get started). Quality is irrelevant; I can learn on my own, reputation is probably neutral, and the price is awesome, since it is a Community College.

Logic,

Looks like we posted back to back, and I think your opinion lines up pretty well with what I've heard.  Since you went there for free, it's great that you had the opportunity to learn as much as possible and execute some of your best-practices to take advantage of virtually free education.  Most people would kill to be in that position!  Also, I think it's great that you're studying music.  Any particular style that appeals to you?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **XlogicX** on Mon October 13th, 2008 11:25:56 PM

Punk and Drum'n'Bass. But I like music/songs from just about any style, and I dislike about the same from every style too. I'm looking to start a band some time soon (play a bass) and figure getting music theory formally is a good way to go. I think getting that line of degrees will be much easier than finding band members that I want  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) --> .

I also agree with the programming degree stuff, you really do need to sit down and spend some time with it. I spent over 3 years at devry for that kind of stuff, and you can still only scratch the surface. Though, my degree was less computer science and more engineering. With UoP, I got my degree in business administration, you have to try kind of hard to screw that one up. So, I don't really have too much regrets in that regard.

I am in UoP and work there also, dirt cheap classes and it really is what the student makes of it. I learn a whole lot and I think that just like any other school there is a failure rate, ours is larger because we have more students and different options. Tech school was a breeze compared to the basic core classes of UoP.

*bump*

UAT, UoP, Devry, Collins..
I've been tainted with "throwing" away 60K into a degree from UAT.  There were a small hand full of teachers that were knowledgeable, but I'd have to say most of the classes were "self-taught" and the teacher didn't give a turd about your questions.

I regret not doing CC before xfering.

Don't get me started on the other schools, I've seen people get degrees from there and are dumb as a post.  Someone mentioned above about "simply getting a programming degree and not understanding what is learned":  That pretty much sums up *most* programming jobs - I've known several people who quit jobs like that because the other SENIOR programmers had no idea what to do.

Degree != a full understanding.

Wow. This is a very very relevant-to-my-interests subject!

So... my experience with tech schools and higher education in general. :::sigh:::

The first thing is to know what you want and what you want to do in your a career. That was my first mistake about higher learning. It doesn't really matter where one goes to get the knowledge they seek as long as one knows what type of knowledge they want. A person should not spend 6 years at 2 year f**king CC! 

With that out of the way, my advice is to pick the school that is right for you. Looking to become a SysAdmin? Maybe all you need is an AS degree from a community college. Looking to program? A BS degree from an **accredited** university will do the trick, one that might have an accelerated program if you're up to it. Supporting yourself or a family? Maybe you should look into online degrees in Software Engineering and have a portfolio of programs you made on your spare time. If all you want is to have the "prestige" :::snickering::: of working in IT, then just get a general BS degree, maybe in Lib Arts and/or have a cert and some experience in like PC repair under your belt. 

For those considering the school option, the way NOT to do it is what I've done. Namely, going to school part time at a CC taking every class, not really choosing a program of study, wasting time paying out of pocket because of ignorance of financial aid options ("lol, isn't financial aid for poor kids?" DUMBASS!), and just going for higher education because its what everyone else is doing and a mind is terrible thing to waste. BAH! Don't do school my way.

Really I like to fix things. I'm damn good at it too and can tell anyone else with patience how to fix something. Fixing a PC is like a zen exercise to me and running a server farm would be like my dream job. But alas, here I am at 31 with shit to show for anything, let alone a dream job. I f**ked up on the way to an IT job (remind me - how the hell do I go from working on a Comp Sci degree to working on a Mech Eng Tech degree in 12 years? Just ask me that). Now with the economy in dire straits (it's gonna get worse boys and girls) I don't know if I can get an IT job. 

So in the end it's really about what you want to do and then going from there in how to get it. I just gave the most expedient routes to where you want to be depending what you want to do. And learn from my example kids. I'll be my granddad's age before I get an IT job, all because I screwed up and didn't really figure out a good plan of action and deciding what I really wanted to do. That's is key. GNOTHI SEAUTON. 

Anyway, I got a thread I want to post separate from this subject but related to it, so to avoid threadjacking, I'm stopping here. Peace.
