## Xilinx FPGA
Posted by **nak** on Fri December 24th, 2010 06:20:38 AM

Who's designed their own computer chips?  I got a Spartan 3 board off ebay instead of eating, it was only 55 bucks (siiiick xD) and was planning to just turn it into a nice little logic analyzer (the sump project:http://www.sump.org/projects/analyzer/)
Just got the IDE working on this laptop here in phoenix, all my good stuff is back up in flagstaff so I haven't been able to test it yet...but the more I learn about FPGAs the &quot;harder&quot; I get... it really blows my mind to know I have access to this kind of technology for what some people spend on a meal!
I would think xLogic would be really interested in this kind of technology, seeing how appreciative he is of the propeller architecture... imagine making your own architecture to program in O.O;;
Eitherway, I'm excited and looking for helpfulness iAi here...
Will keep updated, iAi

I did some Verilog in my undergrad work.

You'll be using that or Vhdl, both very similar.

Its interesting programming parallel structural modules into the hardware.

A very different concept then coding a linearly executed software application.

It sure is exciting when you have found something exciting on which you can try a lot of new stuff like the FPGA – and it is a technology that you can really experiment on!! I am sure that with a little help and guidance you can come up with a whole lot of novel ideas!!

I have a massive book on Verilog if you wanna check it out.

Takes you from half-adder all the way through implementing your own RISC processor.

Let me know.

I used to have an old Altera chip, same idea. It's really cool having a programmable logic device; it can speed certain tasks up when running by the side of a PIC or whatnot.
