in response to penguins article he makes some very valid points
i know rax discussed some good ideas at the last meeting 
but maybe it is time to discuss, plan and implement a phx2600 2.0
what would be like to see changed
what do you like 
what more could this group do 
how can we showcase our talents better to attract more attention 
just general discussions on where we can go from here

I think a shift to &quot;hackerspace&quot; style infrastructure would be pretty cool.

Footing the initial bill would be the biggest hurdle and then maintaining a large enough user base to fund the whole ordeal.

I want to keep it as open as possible. Involve the public and &quot;non-members&quot; as much as possible.

Someplace to showcase our stuff you know.

Maybe even get a bar in there... Who knows.

Defintley agree a hacker space type set up would work good as if say you and I wanted to work on something together having the space would be much more easy than trying to figure out where and when to meet up. Also as much as I hate to admit it the numbers don't lie maybe phx2600 needs a facebook page manned by a few of us it would help us reach a bigger audience as well as possibly met new people that just don't know we exist

We should work on a software project together. That would be awesome. Wouldn't it be cool if we made a phx2600 irc client? I know it's not the most practical project but I think it would be really fun.

Figure to set up a hacker space type idea we need at least four people for a planing committee

This is relevant to my interests. 

I think a hackerspace is a good thing. 
Besides a location with internet and a bathroom here's a suggested list of things we could use:
[list:lm3fxjkd]fridge
microwave
small set of silverware
disposable cups/plates/bowls
paper towels
toilet paper
sofa 
folding chairs (at least 5)
folding tables ( at least 2)
outlet strips
a floor lamp
a few worklight/normal lights
tv &amp; dvd player
a router for ethernet computer hookups
a network printer that everyone can print to
a wifi access point
a decent solder station
Storage of some sort ( we could tie storage space to monthly dues)
A few bottles of cleaning solution[/list:u:lm3fxjkd]

Most of this stuff we can probably get from people's donations or from craigslist/Goodwill's 50% off day.

A few things we could use not relating to physical items in the space:
[list:lm3fxjkd]paypal subscription setup so the treasurer doesn't have to mess with deposits. 
A CYA (cover your ass) membership agreement with standard stuff like don't be a dick, don't do illegal things, clean up after yourself etc. 
We could use a press/liason point of contact person who will get the email for the group, respond accordingly and does a bit of publicity. [/list:u:lm3fxjkd]

If we create a hackerspace in the next few months I can supply some of this.
I can pledge: 
[list:lm3fxjkd]a TV (25&quot; tube I think) 
a 5ish foot folding table maybe two, 
a network printer ( I have an old school HP 4050n that almost any kind of computer can print to)
*might* be able to do the DVD player. I have one for sure I can donate but I don't know where the remote is for it.
[/list:u:lm3fxjkd]

On Facebook: Love it or hate it (most people don't understand why you should hate it) it is a very popular way for people to connect.  A group page there and maybe a small ad targeted at people who's interests are computers / programming  or other keywords the week of a meeting may be a cool way to go.

i got about 20 universal remotes laying around so if we get a dvd without remote its an easy fix
me an rax0r along with a few others here and there have been throwing alot of ideas arpund mainly on twitter and tinychat and its seems to be the main way we are speaking about this best bet is it get with one of us on twitter

I believe I have a WRT-54GL with Tomato firmware on it I can donate as the router/WiFi AP.  Will check on this at a later point in time.

To be honest this is  bad ass idea and I would be all on board to donate, participate, and help out any way possible to keep it going. You should see the shit I built in Afghanistan with just 2x4. Seriously I would stock the bar when necessary, because IMHO alcohol has made the world possible it is the key to any great civilization, and enterprise. Not to mention Taxis would love it and probably give a discount. Might even be better if it was near the light rail.

I read penguin's well written rant on the main page and the thread here.
Same thing happened again.
Great ideas, people willing to throw down get stuff going without any action.
The next part might sound mean, but hell, this is how shit gets done, we didn't learn how to program Java and C# &quot;in the beginning&quot;, we learned how to make silicon into non-mechanical switches and from there we Bool'd around and the rest is history.
Same with anything, FOUNDATIONS need to be laid to have any sort of fruition occur, it's not rocket science or King Solomon's secret ring here...
So we've done the first step visualizing... each of us has a different vision of course, even if we were all in the same room and were asked to write a page of what the room &quot;was&quot; we would all be focusing on different things, I might be checking out what kind of food people are eating, and maybe some chick's ass... you would probably be comparing ePhone-penii sizes...

The second step, with my method <!-- s:roll: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><!-- s:roll: --> I call &quot;carving the bone&quot; (planning)... we want a hacker space right?  A place to chill, drink, hack, solder etc... we want to see our vision become &quot;realer&quot; than nebulous mind jizz with no mother to take root within. But this bone we're carving here doesn't really look like a bone yet, its more of a chunk of marble that a few people walked by and hit with sloppy cocks and maybe left some oil marks on it... we're dogs, and dogs don't chase things that look like that, we chase things that look like BONES with MARROW inside.

SO seriously if you guys want to get this shit done, put the nifty t-shirts, cool new domain names, bars, taxis... what the fuck ever on the back burner... sure dream about it, yeah it needs to get someday but that's the frosting on the cake, we don't even have a proper bone to chase at the moment.

In my humble(hah.) opinion we need to think about these things first:
1. Location
a. Type of location
Warehouse, basement, retail studio space... I don't know! We're nubs and we need to admit that when it comes to setting up and running a thing like this.  Questions that need to be asked and answered: Where and how are others set up that have already been through all the visualising, carving, throwing and chasing? I know a guy who lived in San Fran for a bit, and they had a nice hacker space there... maybe I'll get into contact with him (and in the same vein as penguin &quot;if there is any interest&quot;) and some agents in my metacortex are telling me that there is a hacker-space-something like that here in the valley/tempe? Anyone want to enlighten this asshole as to if it's real and operational or anything like what we want or have resources to duplicate?  Is there a way of piggybacking on them if they exist?

Eh, I guess that's it.  Location people, and $$ bills ... I'm broke as a... something really broke and rude and tired...
and hungry.
Forgive my harshness, I didn't leave with a bang, just thought I'd return with one!  But let me know if there is some mark I'm missing...  when you see your target as big as an elephant, then fire.

*edit*
TerrorDrone do you use a cellphone to post a lot? I think you meant &quot;the fut[b:4uxbjt0s]u[/b:4uxbjt0s]re&quot; as the title of the thread... I understand loosing brain cells to alcohol and drugs as well just being born with half a head full of corn syrup, so no offense if you just have issues with that kind of stuff (like spelling) but laziness...  <!-- s:x --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /><!-- s:x -->
If your heart isn't behind it, find something that your heart will beat furiously behind and do that.  I'm not impressed by much and I've got only handful of things to prove and they are always slipping through my fingers.

My issue is I've cut it all to bits in the last year, study study study, that was my bone, studying the process of &quot;fuck-mess&quot; and when I realized the bone and the stone and the stone-worker and tools are all stone dressed up differently, you sorta just get happy from breathing, eating and playing dressup with &quot;stone&quot;...
So let's do this guys.  Together we can do anything.

*edit^2*
Boy do I feel like I jerk... I see what you meant TD: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://futre.co.za/">http://futre.co.za/</a><!-- m -->

There's been some research done in this area when HeatSync Labs was looking into locations last year.  Its shared with cybersauce on our wiki. Have a look: [url:2mk5gyik]http&#58;//www&#46;heatsynclabs&#46;org/wiki/Location[/url:2mk5gyik].  The downtown PHX location is ran by an eccentric artist and Roosevelt Row is full of tweakers and hipsters.  The information is almost a year old, so it might be a bit outdated...

Downtown Chandler, actually.  Its a bit far for most people, but its very real: [url:2mk5gyik]http&#58;//www&#46;heatsynclabs&#46;org[/url:2mk5gyik].  We're in the processing of buying a laser cutter.  At the moment, HSL is itself piggybacking off of Gangplank, but rumor has it that they may be moving to a bigger space in Tempe this year...

First I need to apologize for being ungracious, especially to TD. <!-- s:oops: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" /><!-- s:oops: --> I feel really bad about my remarks, Everything really... but that's for me to carry it seems.
There is no excuse, I need to keep my mind in check, and level up my maturity.  I've also learned something about morality and intention vs. result of intention and where thing(s) really get to me.  Sorry for unloading guys, but we all have probably felt like jaded aliens at some point in our lives.

Second, I thank dxh for taking the time to bounce ideas back at me, non-the-less, with a good frosting of information!  I feel like I'm getting back in the loop, ...a loop ...any loop.
The hackerspace is surrounded by tweakers and hipsters? Well, I won't say anything self-deprecating or anything about Flagstaff, but I'm thinking it.  <!-- s:? --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><!-- s:? --> 

Nak is begging for forgiveness in his own twisted way, although I'm not even sure I'm 'supposed' to be doing that.  It's like I'm trying to look over my shoulder for instructions on how to live and die... but all I see is some other guy looking over his shoulder, looking over his shoulder.... ad infinitum.  It's a scary sight, and it's hard dancing on the razor's edge.

Dearest Nak,
yeah i post a a lot from cell phone and have fat fingers so my spelling leaves much to desired. No offense taking anyways I'm pretty damn thick skinned. Plus if we can't laugh at our own flaws what right do we have to laugh at others.

edit
we have also scouted locations and are currently in the planning stage of fund raising most everything has been put on hold due to the holidays but will be back up for discussion after the new years. As of right now we want to do things a bit different than the HSL guys. Not that there is anything wrong with the way they do things we just have a different vision. We do look forward to working with, sharing ideas and resources with them though.

There is no panacea that I know of.  I didn't even know that Unlimited Coffee was no longer our meeting place.  I've started a group through ASU-West known as The Digital Diablos.  It has much of the same feel as phx2600 except it's established leadership roles in order to give responsibility to those that that want it.  It also give credit to those that have put in the hours.  Using Facebook.com helps greatly in order to allow members to post on the wall to quickly get something to everyone or using the 'meeting/event' feature to quickly message people and provide another board for members to post about presentations or special guests.  It's not great, but it works well enough.
Communication within the 2600 community doesn't seem to be great.  The zine is only quarterly, which is a huge gap then add in that everything is conducted via snail mail... have you looked at the 2600.com lately?  It's still the same xml posting style it's always been.  There is no subordinate site support.
Just a thought.
