CloudFlare brings the performance and security tools previously reserved for the Internet giants to the rest of the web.

What does that mean?  Can you be more specific? What "performance and security tools" are you talking about?  To my knowledge many of the internet giants use the same (FOSS) tools available to you and me, they just have the money to provide a robust infrastructure to back these tools.

From their website:

[quote:3c0h0byo]On average, a website on CloudFlare

- loads twice as fast
- uses 60% less bandwidth
- has 65% fewer requests
- is way more secure[/quote:3c0h0byo]

I guess that's what passes as a "security metric"
