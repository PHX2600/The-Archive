How are phone calls switched today? is there a map of all of the switches??

Also, are calls to Hawaii done via satellite?

Most North American calls are switched by 5Es and DMS-100s at the CO level.
Tandems include 4Es, DMS-200s, as well as 5Es and 100s. And what you want is the

I don't know how calls to Hawaii are routed. I'll keep researching. Here are a
couple of links that provide technological and historical overviews:

Definitely familiar with the Mediterranean cables though:
