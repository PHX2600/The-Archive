## &quot;gk2gk&quot; Security Watermarks
Posted by **jargon** on Thu December 3rd, 2009 02:17:36 AM

Apparently gk2gk uses watermarking in their logo as a security measure. My guess is that the watermarking tells them who ripped off the site, when the site was ripped off, and whether the person(s) ripping off the site were logged in at the time or not.

&quot;gk2gk&quot; is a date/friend matching site for intellectuals and other geeks.

On another note, currently the user profile image uploader does not work with either some or all png images.
