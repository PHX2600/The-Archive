## UE after the May Meeting?
Posted by **XlogicX** on Sun April 27th, 2008 04:47:17 AM

I have a friend from work that liked the idea of UE when it was described to him. He will be &quot;sick&quot; from work that day to check the meeting out. Anyone have any cool UE ideas for after the meeting (Dual?, ArchAngel? anyone?)?

In my opinon the Builtmore area is a pretty sweet place to explore, alot of unattended maintenance rooms and even some dungeons...

See if you can find this place...

You know, there are a lot of cool places to UE in the PHX. Check maintenance tunnels under any of the big malls (Metro Center, AZ Mills, etc) -- there are tons of long empty darkened corridors, if memory serves. 

Another cool place to do UE is any of the big hotels -- think like the Sheraton, etc. Most of them have a hidden basement and/or sub-basement level that's cool to wander through ... and naturally they're open at night, because, come on, they're a hotel. Find stairwells, or burst into abandoned kitchens and look for service elevators -- big places have tons of huge freight elevators that lead to crazy back staff areas. If anybody stops you claim you're looking for your room and got lost. Hospitals are pretty cool, too -- although these days security is a lot tighter than it used to be.

Most of the cool UE in the PHX is just finding abandoned places -- I've literally not been in the PHX for a year now, so I'm not sure what's been constructed and not yet -- but there was a cool shell of a haus I explored once that had been involved in some murder years ago and nothing was ever done with the land. O_o;; Was mostly just a foundation, but a cool place to chill; it was backed almost into a mountain but I'd have to look up the address.

Another thought -- and this doesn't really count as UE, since it's public and guided -- is to check out the newspaper processing plant. It's huge and crazy, especially if they let you go into the storerooms where they keep a literal forest of blank newsprint -- very industrial.

Dunno if this actually helps or not, but hopefully gives you some ideas -- UE is really just about wandering places regular joe citizen isn't going to go, so there are lots of cool candidate choices in the sprawl.
