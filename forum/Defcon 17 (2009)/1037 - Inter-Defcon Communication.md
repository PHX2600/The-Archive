## Inter-Defcon Communication
Posted by **PHLAK** on Fri July 24th, 2009 08:06:49 PM

For the last several hours I've been trying to think of a way for all us Phx2600 groupies to keep in touch at Defcon.  Some ideas I had that I felt wouldn't work gracefully include: a dedicated topic on these forums, IRC, a chat room of some sort or just plain old text messaging.

As I thought about it more, I came up with one viable solution with an infrastructure already in place: Twitter!  The only effort needed would be on the people (you guys and myself) to make sure everyone has everyone elses Twitter ID's and and we're all following each other.  So anyone wanting/willing to keep in touch while at Defcon should post their Twitter name and a link to their page so everyone else can follow them.  So let me start, you can find me at:

Aside from the bulk chit-chat and notifications I'll be posting on my personal account, I'm planning on making any big Defcon announcements via [url=http&#58;//twitter&#46;com/phx2600:3migzexa]@PHX2600[/url:3migzexa], so make sure you're following that account as well.

If anyone has any other ideas of how con-goers can keep in touch with each other, please voice your opinions here, I'd love to hear them!

For the last several minutes I've been trying to think of a way for all us Phx2600 groupies to keep in touch at Defcon. Some ideas I had that I felt wouldn't work gracefully include:twitter.

As I thought about it more, I came up with one viable solution with an infrastructure already in place: Ham Radio! The only effort needed would be on the people (you guys and myself) to make sure everyone has everyone elses Call sign's and we're all on the same frequency. So anyone wanting/willing to keep in touch while at Defcon should post their call sign and a frequency so everyone else can follow them. So let me start, you can call me at:

As awesome as that would be, I don't have a ham radio, or a call sign, and I bet many others don't as well... :'-(

Me and my caravan used Twittah for interDefcon communication last year.  It worked out quite well.

Last year, I was noticing there were quite a few people from AZ there that weren't in phx2600.  Perhaps an impromptu Grand Canyon State meetup/party would be fun?

That sounds like a great idea, but how are we going to get the word out to all of them, and where will we have this meetup?  A pizza joint is always a good place to meet.

@Konshu is mine, however DM / Google Talk / BB messenger are the best ways to get a hold of me as they are always available instantly.

I thought about instant messaging as well, and while that will work between you and I, not everyone has a smart phone.  Not having a smart phone doesn't affect Twitter because you can tweet via text messages.

I will be working with you Phlak to keep the site updated with news and events, coverage, etc. We should be able to keep stuff interesting on @PHX2600.
