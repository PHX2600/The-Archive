Guess what I just heard that the PSN (Playstation Sony Network) was hacked by some leet haxor crew that uses IRC to talk to eachother and then SQLI into DBs and then get hashes and passes and CC#s.

Seems like the ghost of the times is all about leet hackers now... or something has been stirring the hive's nest.

Eitherway, this board needs to go away, or Ghostshell needs to start posting like a bot again...
