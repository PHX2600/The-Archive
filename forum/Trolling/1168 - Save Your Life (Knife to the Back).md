This video shows how to get out of a knife to the back situation:

This doesn't work very well at all in a &quot;hostage&quot; knife situation, so keep that in mind.

More knife show more knife attack experience and info (to the neck):

Police version by a different videography group where the knife flies willy-nilly and the attacker pretends to be hurt/wounded in-order for scenario presentation of strict attempt upon self to inflict mortal attack:

In real life, police shoot to wound/kill upon lesser than 2 seconds of ground to be covered by man wielding a knife. This can be as much as 30 to 40 feet distance to cover.

Remember, a man on PCP can take as many as six to nine direct gunshots to the chest before going down, even if already mortally wounded.

No, I still really don't see how the L.A. Rodney King riots are justifiable. Maybe certain people in L.A. are just stupid as fuck due to poor role models and poor upbringing.

Notice most people end up in the Black Panthers after poor treatment by law enforcement, notice this specific man only got in trouble for law enforcement for *actually* committing a heinous after *after* being in the Black Panthers. This is my small example of bad egg role models that actually did end up doing something right for once in their lives, but still qualify as poor role models.

Yes, I really do believe some people are just plain born evil.

Do you really have to ask, &quot;*SOME* PEOPLE?&quot;

Did I say, &quot;*YOU* people?&quot;, no I did not. Stop being a fucking dumbass.
