## Some fairly fast rainbows

This guy found that a standard hard-drive is usually a bottleneck for password cracking, he used an SSD and got some better crunches. At the bottom of his page, you can paste a 14 character maximum NTLM password hash and it will crack it. Usually takes a couple of seconds:

Honestly that's about the same speed I am getting off of magnetic media with a modest RAID array. I recommend anyone that has a spare TB or so to grab the NTLM rainbow table for yourself and try it out. 
Can get NTLM(879 GB) here: <http://www.freerainbowtables.com/tables/>
There are also links to LM, MD5, SHA1, and HALFLMCHALL tables.

Thank you haven't seen the local scene for about 15 years now, got curious on how it was progressing. Was looking for location of the hamfest over the weekend and found the forum through a post here to the hamfest, so decided to check the place out <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->
