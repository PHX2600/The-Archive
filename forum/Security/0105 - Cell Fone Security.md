Mad props to [url=http&#58;//en&#46;wikipedia&#46;org/wiki/Bruce_Schneier:1p6stylz]Bruce Schneier[/url:1p6stylz] for linking these in [url=http&#58;//www&#46;schneier&#46;com/blog/archives/2008/05/cell_phone_spyi_1&#46;html:1p6stylz]his blog[/url:1p6stylz] -- interesting enough that I thought I'd share with you all here:

First up, Flexispy is apparently a service (only in Europe?) that allows their clients to enter a mobile phone number and then listen in on the microphone. Pretty afternow-ish.

In a similar vein, world-tracker reputes to be able to pinpoint people's location using cell towers. I'm honestly not sure how useful this would be, but, uh, whatever floats your boat I guess.

I looked at that flexispy site, it looks like they supply the cellphone that you can spy with... I guess they put some special firmware on it or something... I hope.

Ah, you know -- I didn't even look into it that far, but that's a shame as opposed to them marketing active over-the-air interception devices. :-/ I guess it helps them get over privacy concerns, though.
