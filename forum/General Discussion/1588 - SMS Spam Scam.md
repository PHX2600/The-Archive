Got this text yesterday.

LimitedFreeStuff.com forwards to vipbidders.com and is a standard address harvester. Clicking unsubscribe goes to edebitinc.com.

Running mild on edebitinc.com gets...

[code:204d5qu4]mail.edebitinc.com.     14400   IN      CNAME   edebitinc.com.
edebitinc.com.          14400   IN      A       67.227.163.113
dev.edebitinc.com.      14400   IN      A       67.227.163.113
localhost.edebitinc.com. 14400  IN      A       127.0.0.1
www.edebitinc.com.      14400   IN      CNAME   edebitinc.com.
edebitinc.com.          14400   IN      A       67.227.163.113
ftp.edebitinc.com.      14400   IN      A       67.227.163.113
webmail.edebitinc.com.  14400   IN      A       67.227.163.113
stats.edebitinc.com.    14400   IN      A       67.227.163.113[/code:204d5qu4]

A login for stats.edebitinc.com is stats: stats. There you can see the referrers feeding the scam site...

[code:204d5qu4]http://www.mobilepornxxx.mobi/index-320.php?res=320
http://getdrugs2u.com/join/signup.php?step=2
[/code:204d5qu4]

which correlate to Site IDs.

[code:204d5qu4]drg2u
etxtc
mpxxx
uketc[/code:204d5qu4]

etxtc is easytextchat.com. Going into the referrers you can see the similarities in the affiliate network.

Hopefully a small, interesting look into profiting from clicky users.
