## Learning Java
Posted by **PHLAK** on Fri January 2nd, 2009 04:09:10 PM

So my new years resolution for 2009 is to learn Java to a degree that I can at least do simple programming for my BlackBerry Storm.  Therefore I turn to you guys for help on finding resources that will help me in my quest to learn Java.  Any format is great, online content is preferable.  Now bring on the information!

Oh cool, I wasn't sure you saw that. I decided to go to start going through that book too (haven't used the java language in years). Chapter 1 was a very nice introduction to oop and associated concepts and keyword, hope I remember all that or all keep having to flip back to that page. Swing isn't till Chapter 11 or 12, and that's a downer cause swing is really fun to play with. On your blackberry you'll prolly have to learn a totally different UI library, when I was into palm pilots and the kvm and j2me (Java 2 Micro Edition), basically the underlying java language was the same but the libraries were different, but still you could accomplish pretty much the same things.

Well, I purchased &quot;Java for Dummies&quot;, and IMHO it was a damn good $20 investment. The way they teach you in that book is perfect for me.  Also, my coworker lent me &quot;Java Desk Reference for Dummies&quot; (9 books in 1, about twice as thick as Java for Dummies).  Lastly, a friend of mine lent me &quot;Data Structures &amp; Other Objects Using Java&quot; book from his 2nd Java course at ASU.

So between the 3 physical books, one e-book and multitudes of information available online I think I'll be set. I'm already approximately 2/3 - 3/4 done with &quot;Java for Dummies&quot;, and I've learned a lot, can't wait to keep learning!

If anyone cares, you can go [url=http&#58;//www&#46;chriskankiewicz&#46;com/documents/index&#46;php?dir=java/testing/:1du5llio]here[/url:1du5llio] to see a number of the tutorials I've been doing from &quot;Java for Dummies.&quot;

Bruce Eckel's &quot;Thinking in Java&quot; is the best and only book you will ever need on the subject.

I've been jumping through hoops in my classes trying to learn this stuff to create whatever crud the professors want.

The link above I found to be great for a quick primer on the topic, I've went through the majority of the &quot;learning the Java Language&quot; portion in spare time that I had at work.  There's also a section solely for the .Swing package.

If you're into networking:

<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/Programming/BasicJava2/socket.html">http://java.sun.com/developer/onlineTra ... ocket.html</a><!-- m -->
should help a bit.

A little more abstract, but:

idk, I've got more - push me a note if you need something more specific than this.

Thanks, but I've given up on Java for the most part.  I do not like it.  I'll stick to my PHP and Python thank you.
