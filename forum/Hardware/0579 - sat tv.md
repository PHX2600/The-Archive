I don't have spectrum analyzer, but if you get a USRP (700 bux + a daughterboard) you can turn your PC into one.  I still want a USRP <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

I know people use those dishes for directional wifi, just put a usb dongle at the focal point of the dish.
