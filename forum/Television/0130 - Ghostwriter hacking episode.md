## Ghostwriter hacking episode!
Posted by **taryn** on Tue July 1st, 2008 07:21:37 PM

The first time I ever heard the term HACKER was in this episode. This is from
1993. The show was called Ghostwriter and it was on PBS. This was my favorite
show as a little kid. I won't spoiler you guys as to who the HACKER is but you
should watch it for the lulz factor anyway. Check out Julia Stiles as a .. what
is that? A grungey computer geek I suppose. And they write sloooooooow. This
episode is awesome. zaph's making fun of me for watching this now.

Ok here's the premise of the show: There's a group of kids and they have this
weird little dude who writes words to them and they solve mysteries all around
Brooklyn. Usually the episodes were split into 3-4 parts and were a half hour
each, shown each Saturday morning.

WORD.

Here are the links:

TOTALLY AWESOME!  I used to watch this show as a kid, in fact, I was just
thinking about Ghostwriter a few days ago.

My two favorite parts were:


  * when the teacher mentions "disk's" in the first episode and holds up a CD
    joking because CD's are used for music and, god forbid, storing digital
    media or viruses, and...
  * when they showed an ACTUAL DIRECTORY LISTING!!!  This alone is one of the
    most accurate representations of computers/software in all media I've ever
    seen!

But yes... all in all, hilarious and entertaining!

Yeah iamghostwriter2 has uploaded a bunch of them. Yesterday after Max Mouse I
watched "What's Up With Alex?" which is a "rare episode" because it was only
shown a few times on PBS since it was a special drug episode and when Noggin
started rerunning them, they never showed that one because O NOZ MARIJUANA!

Anyway how are they able to type half a letter at a time while chatting with Max
Mouse?! PHLAK I liked that disk/CD part too, ha. Then he holds up a mini disco
ball and the kids laugh as if it were funny??? I also love how after they got
kicked off the bulletin board they spent what looked like two hours trying to
write something "funky" back to Max Mouse so that [s]he would accept them.
