## Why

Does it say:

2008 Meeting Photos
(2 albums)

But when I click I only see January? Is the other album private or something?

This is probably the wrong forum. o_O

What is happening is I created an album for February, but didn't put any photos in it.  Therefore, it believes there's 2 albums, but doesn't show the album with no pictures in it.

Ah ok that makes sense, thanks.
