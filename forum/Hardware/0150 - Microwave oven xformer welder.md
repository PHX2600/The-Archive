I just finished knocking the secondaries out and will wrap the 10awg wire tomorrow, I'll keep you guys updated as long as I still have a pulse and my house isn't burned down.  <!-- s:? --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><!-- s:? -->

Yeah I got it to arc finally: It did this to the peice of metal: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_g0Pvp8R4hq4/SIOg29WQ4oI/AAAAAAAAABk/jFlmvao2Ges/s1600-h/IMG_4154.JPG">http://bp0.blogger.com/_g0Pvp8R4hq4/SIO ... G_4154.JPG</a><!-- m -->
The problem was, I didn't know how to strike an arc, it takes a really precise distance between the metal and the electrode, then the electrode starts melting and you have to push it in with the arc, but not too fast or you get stuck to the metal you are working on...

Then the secondaries started smoking <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( -->

And it doesn't work anymore.
The End. Damn.

This is kind of a funny hack.

I successfully welded a steel nut to a piece of clean exhaust tubing to be used as an intake vent on a car, with welding wire. I passed it thru a brass metal piece that functioned to transfer current to the welding wire, which I pushed in by hand.

Power was supplied from the vehicles battery via high quality jumper cables (rated to start engines, not just transfer a battery charge). - was connected to the pipe to avoid the need to pass back thru the body of the car, and + was used to hold the brass metal piece. The jumper cable clips were all copper, save for the spring mechanism and rubber handle, which probably also helped in keeping the brass piece from absorbing too much heat.

Yeah, it occasionally 'clogged'; what else would you expect, making your own tip and all. 

But, it worked. In spite of being only 12V instead of 24V, and in spite of lacking any sort of coil with which to sustain the arc. It was, after all, a [b:mnhuuyri]very small weld[/b:mnhuuyri], so having [b:mnhuuyri]very little coil[/b:mnhuuyri] (only the induction inherent in the wire itself, actually) meant that I could stay [b:mnhuuyri]very close[/b:mnhuuyri] to the weld target without overheating anything.

I think the main benefit to owning a standard arc welder is that you learn how to use the equipment everyone else also has lying around...

That is a great hack <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

They also have an instructable similar to that using batteries out of a golf-cart I believe
