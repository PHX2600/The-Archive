## classifieds URL ideas

All of these domains are open unless otherwise noted.

**hackadeal.com** - Generic

**dumpsterdiveteam.com **- inspired by NaK's shirt ( I think he handed rights to it to jinx though )

**notahacker.com **- based on rax's shirt.

**bobparsonsisafag.com** - I laughed so hard, this is actually a live domain and points to parson's site

**feelingused.com **- kind of funny
