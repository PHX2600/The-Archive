We should prepare for the Crack Me If You Can competition on the July meeting, since August we'll be out at Defcon.

Great idea.  I'm almost done downloading the ntlm_mixalpha_num#1-8 rainbow tables.  Need to get them to Penguin.  Anything else we can do to prepare would be nice as well.

I have All Sha1/MD5 Tables that we will need.

I can bring on a sata drive if anyone has a SATA enclosure.

And hazard's "Blur your eyes and look at it..." was another great hint to the [http://www.abovesobelow.com/music.dump](music.dump) one.
