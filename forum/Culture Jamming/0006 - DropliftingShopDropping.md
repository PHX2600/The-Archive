Wow, that sounds great, there are so many things that can be done with this, I
can't beleive that I havn't tought of it before. We can even print out barcodes
that will ring up as something else if someone tries to purchase the product
(assuming that it is not in the stores database, and that is a good assumption).
If the checker doesn't notice (funny either way), then the consumer may actually
be able to pay money for it. Although the store gets the profit, it is still bad
on their inventory. Wow, I'm going to let this one boil for a bit.

Ive mentioned a movie on the old board called "The Yes Men" there was a short
section on this, even though there was no hip name associated with the act.

To summarize: They bought GI Joe talking toys and Barbie talking toys, switched
the voice circuits and then placed them back on the shelf covertly.  Lulz
ensued.

I did a copycat prank at Radioshack were I took the sound board out of a
returned truck toy and put it in a mobile phone demo where they had talking
caller ID, it now plays some rock music  :P

I think most big-box stores have telxon guns - some of which, at least, have the
power to alter inventories. It might be worth downloading a manual for one of
the more popular models in the PHX and then scanning your barcode into the
system for added legitimacy. Doubly humourous for whomever has to go back out
the change from the database, that way - "Looks like we have thirteen hundred
thirty seven of these things in the store somewhere, Paul!". *grinz*

Hey, culture jamming (like any hacking) can have political motivation, too.
Maybe rewire some barcodes to scan as "RonPaul" and price them at "$20.08"?
Logic would probably be able to tell you more about building custom barcodes
than I could. ^_-.

Posted by **XlogicX** on Sat December 29th, 2007 10:14:24 AM

Unfortunately, I couldn't think of many ways to do that. A bar code is pretty
much just a 12 digit number. The bar code number for a 12oz can of Mt Dew is the
same number at albertsons as it is at frys. So that also means that the price is
not inherently stored on the barcode either, it is determined by the store. I'm
just refering to the UPC kind though, you could probably do what your refering
to with a code-128 barcode, at least in text.

It would be worth it just to do that to a store.it'd be fun to change out dvds
too, does anyone have a shrink wrapper?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **phigan** on Sun December 30th, 2007 05:16:17 PM

There's botnet potential in this, kinda...

Package up a CD with pictures of games all over it.. Promise all kinds of crap,
it doesn't really matter.. then put a 99cent pricetag and the UPC of some
bubblegum/candy on it.. Stick it next to the DVDs by the front or in a checkout
line.

What's on the CD? Random evil backdoors and things, of course.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **PHLAK** on Sun December 30th, 2007 06:18:56 PM

Sounds like something my friends and I thought up after hearing about the Nine
Inch Nails music on thumb drives left in restrooms.  Leave random thumb drives
around with GonZor's Payload on them and have it email what it logs to you.  I'd
be willing to bet more than a few people are dumb enough to open random thumb
drives on work computers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **XlogicX** on Mon December 31st, 2007 06:10:58 AM

We could also have a live linux CD with many tools, something like Knoppix-STD.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Medicine Storm** on Wed January 2nd, 2008 11:17:39 AM

Knoppix is not a bad idea. If we want quasi-political motivation, why not
promote a free alternative to expensive software, like ubuntu next to the
windows vista boxes, GIMP next to the Photoshop boxes, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **nak** on Wed January 2nd, 2008 03:08:31 PM

Penguin and I did the Ubuntu next to the windows boxes at compusa, when they
were still open.  :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **XlogicX** on Thu January 3rd, 2008 09:40:24 AM

We could do a phx2600 branded version of knoppix, and put some of our favorite
tools in, or just have a standard STD like version. We could also put links to
our favorite (but relevant) websites in the firefox favorites or something. It
could be a way to whore ourselves out and get more people to show up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **PoH** on Thu January 3rd, 2008 03:47:56 PM

Sounds like quite the plan. Some friends and I had been thinking about putting
porn in DVD's and game cases at wal-mart because, well, wally world is the
devil... but this sounds like a much better idea. Let me know and if something
does come of this if I could get a copy of the disk I will make more copies and
spread them over here in Chandler.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **phigan** on Sat January 5th, 2008 10:16:23 AM

Just make it softporn.. Don't put like 2girls1cup in a Hello Kitty box. You
don't want to traumatize the children.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **PoH** on Thu January 10th, 2008 05:46:06 PM

No, the way I figured it, and would hope it would go down as such that the
parents would open the package, recognize the nakedtivity on the disc then go
and complain at wal-mart... So on and so forth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Medicine Storm** on Fri January 11th, 2008 08:44:20 AM

Yes, but what is our goal? the degridation of wal-mart's reputation or the
promotion of open-source's/Anti-The-Man reputation. I think a kid getting ahold
of porn from wal-mart would affect both reputations negatively here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **PoH** on Sat January 12th, 2008 10:25:18 AM

Quite true, and sorry, yeah, I am an ex wal-mart employee, I was thinking more
of ruining reputations then anything... that's why I suppose I hopped in on this
though was this looked like a much better idea then mine, simply from a moral
point of view.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Medicine Storm** on Mon January 14th, 2008 09:27:22 AM

Oh, don't get us wrong. Destructing the reputation of (one of) the largest and
scheming-est corporations ever is a good thing. After all, this is the Culture
Jamming forum, I was only looking for the most _effective_ culture jam. We are
white-hat, but morals were not our motivation here. We wanted to hit all the big
expensive software companies as well as the big retail stores at the same time
as drawing positive attention to ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **PoH** on Tue January 15th, 2008 12:19:25 AM

Well, as afore mentioned, if I can get a copy of a LiveCD or something we would
like to use I and a few local friends are more then willing to copy them and do
our part out on this side of town (Chandler, East Mesa). I can more then likely
recruit a sleugh (I think that's right?) of people to help out.

P.S.: I like the idea of the freedom of speech bit being added into this, mayhap
making a collaborative video, getting ahold of ZeitGeist (If you haven't seen
it, the entire movie -2 hours- is on Google Videos, go watch it) and putting it
in their, but also, not just freedom of speech but freedom of...well, freedom.

I think either 'slew' or 'slue', depending on what part of the country you're
from. ^_-. </not that it matters since we understood anyway>

I'm actually pretty interested in developing a common package to drop off - it
seems more coordinated, and it's more likely to draw attention to it than
several independent developments - putting yourself in the shoes of J. Random
Shops-At-Wal-Mart, I think it'd have a bigger WTF factor to have several copies
of the PHX2600 Distro in nice boxes (maybe even with price tags that read
something like "FREE (your mind)") right next to the windoze and adobe ones on
the shelf - probably the biggest challenge would be keeping them stocked. It
might also be fun to do this at a Best Buy or one of those stores where they are
likely to have boxed software displayed prominently at the end of an aisle -
hijacking an entire store display is a pretty damn cool way to jam culture,
since it takes all the work of putting something out prominently and rewires it
to our advantage. Again, just my ¥200 though. ^_-.

I like the ideas, but I can't really see a security distribution being that
useful to the public.  I also don't see why image is important if shopdropping
is done anonymously, the only time when 'hacker/phreak' reputation could get
damaged is if the dropper gets caught and says something along the lines of "I
was doing this for phx2600.org! They're hackers, they tricked me!" during
questioning.  It would be an individuals reputation that would be damaged,
unless we started putting porn dvds in children's movies sharpied with our URL
or 'hack the planet!".

I don't think a free OS next to the windows boxes will make a big deal, it did
not when I worked at compusa, and I don't see any sort of attention (positive or
negative) to any community or individual if it were carried out.

If you wanted to be more of an open source activist and less prankster, you
could even call up the store and ask the manager if it was cool to put up your
distro.

If you guys haven't heard of looked up what banksy has actually, I suggest
googling him, his executions were entertaining!

How about in the spirit of "more prankster", we see some ideas on how to get
Apple?

We disagree. If Mr. J. Shops-At-walmart is presented with something that
enlightens him and make his life easier/more enjoyable while at the same time
reveals how corrupt walmart is, then Mr. Shops-At-walmart will shout for more
and seek further enlightenment. However, if Mr. J. Shops-At-walmart is presented
with something that entertains his penis, while at the same time corrupts the
minds of his children (funny!), then Mr. Shops-At-walmart will shout for the
evil hackers to be crucified. If you think the media would attribute this to the
individuals who execute it and not use it to reinforce the "evil dweeb hackers
that can't get laid so they act infantile and ruin everything for no reason"
image, then you haven't been watching the news enough.

If we distribute something that is shocking and offensive (albeit hilarious) as
opposed to shocking and enlightening, we will be painted as the evil empire as
opposed to the righteous rebel alliance. Do not assume this could not be linked
to phx2600.org

We guess the real question is, do we care?

We have seen banksy's work. His work is very well executed. However, even the
authorities felt a subtle air of respect for his pranks. The pranks were
shocking, but tasteful. Illegal, but enlightening. We noticed even the museum
curators, who were his victims, were not overly enthusiastic in hunting him down
to have him locked away.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **XlogicX** on Thu January 17th, 2008 09:47:16 AM

I care; it gets tiring explaining to people what hackers are about. Even if we
don't have the power to change that perception, I still think it is important
that we maintain the positive perception of our group in Phoenix.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **nak** on Thu January 17th, 2008 10:13:07 PM

I was trying to make the point that if shop-dropping was done by an anonymous
individual (for example porn DVDs in children's movies) it wouldn't be related
to hacking activity (not saying that I think its a good idea), on the other hand
hacking a elementary school site and posting porn would defiantly damage the
hacker image.

My post was also a cry for more creativity, porn DVDs replacing children's
movies could be a laugh, but a off the top of the head kind of prank.  And I
already said I wouldn't think putting a linux distribution would be totally rad,
it would be aight, and maybe a couple people would benefit, but I just don't see
it as subversive and cool as something on par with banksy.

Apple stores would be fun (and difficult, very merchandised) to shopdrop, maybe
some fake boxes of "Apple Windows" or "Microsoft OS X" with some ubuntu CD and
whatever literature that proves apple to be evil :P (just off the top of my head
;) )

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, it's not like a contest ... more I'm interested in seeing what problems
people run into and seeing if people get organized than what the specific output
of the group is. Like think of even seeing a PHX2600 distro (and if not a
security distro, than maybe just pre-burned ubuntu .isos or something) in the
back darkened corner of a Fry's Electronics, and knowing that it was logic and
medicine storm and whoever, that's pretty elite; you can work your way up to
bigger and bolder hacks. Agree on the pr0n being a bad idea, though. :-/. Like
it'd kinda' be funny but then only if you could get people's reactions in real-
time; I guess if you had a hidden camera at the customer service / returns desk
it would be youtube material - otherwise you have to rely on the message you're
putting out to be satisfying to say without being able to hear back from
anyone, which is tricky.

On that note - maybe instead of going with Linux distros we could drop some
anti-walmart DVDs in some prominent location? We'd need access to a printer, a
bunch of blank DVD-Rs and a copy of some documentary - probably tons of fodder
on google video and bittorrent. ^_-.

Walmart's little things use wifi w/ WEP to communicate back home... maybe we
should try breaking it, and then reverse engineering the protocol? Or, just
pocket one of the guns.... they leave them layin around the place ontop of boxes
late at night when they're restocking.

Oh yeah! And to top it off, they run **Windows CE**.
