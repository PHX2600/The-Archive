This device was given to me for free, it has never been used but ended up in ASU salvage.

It can pen plot on paper or cut out vinyl or sticker paper.

takes media up to 36 inches wide. 

Now accepting ideas for prints.

I say print out a boarding pass for your next plane ticket on a 4 foot by 3 foot size piece of cardboard! Or you can make one of those giant checks and give it to your power company or something.

That's an awesome snag. I think  you're super lucky.

I just ordered a bunch of old HP plotter pens for it so I can stop using a Jerry rigged sharpie in it.

I also ordered a cutter head with an omnidirectional blade and a few carousels, the carousels allow it to change between up to 8 pens automatically during a plot.

seems like this whole forum is dead right now though, maybe its just spring break.
