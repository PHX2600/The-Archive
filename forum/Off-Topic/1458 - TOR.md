## TOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Posted by **tokiya** on Mon September 19th, 2011 02:59:36 AM

Anybody use Tor?  torproject.org?  Visited a tor site?  I just found this, I'm curious, and lost, and in awe, and easily amused.  If you have, please tell me about it. <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->

Tor's pretty neat.
I don't use it much because of speed issues, but if I need to be pretty anonymous, that's one way to go about it!
Sometimes the exit node is in some foreign country like germany and google picks up on that

Yea, I use Tor all the time. I actually started to help out developing for them a while back but kind of stopped.

That is pretty badass AltF4, I'm still fumbling around it an need to spend more time in the wiki <!-- s:x --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /><!-- s:x -->

I've been using it.  But I was unsuccessful in getting it to work with IRC, which was my original intent for it.  Apparently you could use Tor on IRC circa 2009, but I'm not sure now. You can tell your client to use localhost and port 9050 as your proxy, but it seems all IRC servers will detect the Tor and flip over it.  Speaking of IRC, I don't understand why IRC is so anti-proxy anyway.

Yeah, lol. But in reality, it's just two people that don't like or don't agree with each other.

yep <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> and that's why the multiverse exists instead of the sexiverse

Just for the hell of it, I decided to try again, but switch Tor identities in the middle of connecting to servers....

I only really use TOR for .onion sites. I set up a foxyproxy "pattern" (filter) to switch to TOR only when I navigate or type a .onion site.

That's kind of where I'm at.  I'd usually just rather use a standard proxy.  I wasn't aware of foxyproxy, which is rather dumb of me, because I've been keeping a text file list of proxies and switching manually.   <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: -->  But now I've seen the light. 

Btw, what's a good .onion site to visit?

I'm no veteran, but a place to start if you have no bookmarks is The Hidden Wiki:

Just be carefull what you click on, there's some normal stuff in there, and then there's the really really bad stuff.

HackBB is an interesting "hacker" forum. To me, it seems like a computer criminal forum though. I was amazed that you could go there and just download a cracked copy of SpyEye or Zues (huge malware packs to control your botnet and such). I find it interesting as an outsider though, it's not a scene I'd like to get inolved with.

Oh, and foxyproxy is great. I have 2 proxies set up. one is the TOR 9050 one, and then another 8080 one to my OpenSSH at home. So if I'm in a coffee shop, it's either going to TOR proxy (rare), or it defaults to SSH proxy (not going to see much interesting stuff in wireshark as an outsider).

And the SSH Tunnel is SUPER easy to set up. You can pretty much run a vanilla setup at home (but I suggest disabling root, whitelist who can log in, you probably have to port forward 22 on your router, or, if you decide to go with a different default port altogether, do that with the forwarding). In short, minimum setup at home: default OpenSSH and maybe port forward the router.

For the client (coffee shop box). Just run ssh -D 8080 <!-- e --><a href="mailto:username@1.2.3.4">username@1.2.3.4</a><!-- e -->. where username is your acount on your home box and 1.2.3.4 is your public facing IP, the one your ISP gives you, not your 192.168.x.x. Oh, and 1.2.3.4 is on some malware blacklists BTW <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

For your browser, just 127.0.0.1:8080 on Socks5 (as the proxy setup)

Interesting. I set up a filter for Tor and read earlier about setting up a proxy at home, but not sure if I would need it yet. I'm very much into delving into this more though.

So you would still have your home IP then?   I'm not sure I'd want that, but I can see how this would be useful
for getting around restrictions on certain networks.   In any case, looks like I'll need an implementation of SSH for Windows 7 to get this to work as you've described.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **XlogicX** on Mon January 16th, 2012 11:38:51 AM

There should be something for Windows called sshd, I used in on 2003 server for a while, I forget if you have to configure it past default though.

As far as the home IP, it would be. the ssh proxy isn't something you would use at home. It's something that allows me to be at a coffee shop and have all of my traffic encrypted. All a sniffer would see is a lot of traffic to one IP address, that's it. And it would all be encrypted. They wouldn't even know the websites I was going to. All web traffic at the coffee shop would virtually be like you're doing it at home. It sounds limited, but a great specific feature for something like a public access point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Valveritas** on Mon January 16th, 2012 02:48:11 PM

Ah, I understand now, I was missing the point there.  Good idea. Looks like you can use PUTTY to implement ssh on Windows 7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **XlogicX** on Tue January 17th, 2012 02:34:47 AM

On the client side yeah. So you'd be running sshd (or an alternative) on your home machine, that would be the server. On the laptop or remote computer, you'd be running Putty as the client. I used to run that exact setup for a little while. The ironic thing is that it sounds way more complicated than it is with windows.

On Linux, OpenSSH is typically already running (server). for client, just run the right ssh command in terminal. No software to install, it's all built in. But that's fine, I know that linux is still in the minority.

Those .onion sites connect extremely slow, at least for me.  Even slower than regular sites using Tor.  Hm.

Yeah, expect that.
