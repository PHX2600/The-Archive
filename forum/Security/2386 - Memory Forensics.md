I did a strings search on a memory dump and found some interesting stuff. My question is how the hell do I map that address space back to the process that created it?

woah, old post! Did you find anything out? Sounds pretty impossible unless you were debugging processes when you made the dump and then you might be able to cross reference the two? I have no idea  <!-- s:| --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><!-- s:| -->
