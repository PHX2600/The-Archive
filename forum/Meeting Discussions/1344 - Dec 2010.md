Slackers what is this,

Day before the meet and no Dec meeting thread?

I was planning on bringing all the stuff i just posted to the market place for a hacker-style yard sale.

So if you're interested in any of that stuff you'll have a chance to see it first had at the meet.

Here's something that I found interesting. I'd like to discuss this with others at the December meeting.

<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?e4acfwcic7aih8t">http://www.mediafire.com/?e4acfwcic7aih8t</a><!-- m -->

It's an excerpt from "Security Now" (with Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte).  _If you're not listening to this show, you might want to consider starting. It's very, very good_

Gibson answers a question from a listener about Dot-P2P. A decentralized domain name system that couldn't be taken down at the whim of a government.

Here's a [url=http://torrentfreak.com/bittorrent-based-dns-to-counter-us-domain-seizures-101130/:1pp819br][color=#FF0000:1pp819br]related article[/color:1pp819br]> from TorrentFreak.

@Rax I'll give it a listen

You guys wanna do Lola's again? Getting out a little after 8pm worked well for me last time anyhow

I'll be there today, and yes, it's at Lola's until a better alternative is found or they close down, and based on our track record, the later seems most likely.

Oh, damn. I totally forgot that it was the first Friday yesterday... <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( --> I wanted to give everyone stickers. I bought a pack of those 2600 stickers for everyone. Next time, I guess.

EDIT: Oh, yea. I would totally be interested in working on something to do with P2P DNS. Looks like they need a lot of help. I'd do some cryptography research and general programming for sure. Definitely interested.

@Rax: Nice find.

@Everyone: this is the kind of stuff that should ALSO be posted in the media section. If you find some bit of awesome hacker news, post it there if no one else has yet. 'cause, you know... it's awesome.
