## I lost my keys
Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Tue July 14th, 2009 01:12:53 PM

I have been looking everywhere for this procedural art program I used to play with, you could write out a script and it would generate all sorts of stuff for you, NAK generated a GO board using it and you could do trees and fractals and all sorts of coool stuff.

Anyone know what Im talking about or what its called?

I already tried praying hard to Jesus about it but hes not helping me out anymore after the last &quot;incident&quot;.

Thanks.
