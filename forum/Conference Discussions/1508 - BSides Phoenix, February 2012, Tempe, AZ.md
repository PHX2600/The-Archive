Are you involved with BSides, by chance, Urbal? Or just pointing it out. I may
like to submit in the CFP.

No, not involved, just saw it come through the wire and didn't see it posted
here, so I thought y'all would be interested. I submitted for the CFP.

Hey, both Urbal and I are going to be speaking at BSides! There's still tickets
available (it's free, but you need a ticket). Going to be a blast.

Heyo, I have a workshop all ready to go but if nobody signs up today I'm gonna
have to cancel it!

You learn how to use Arduino Ethernet to query/post to webservices and output
info physically; in this case to LEDs. You can make something like this:
<http://willbradley.name/2011/12/arduino-nagios-display/> or whatever your
imagination can dream up (decks of cards that MITM? Who knows!)

I've just reduced the price and received permission to open it to the public!
The new price barely covers my costs; you take home an Arduino Ethernet, my
custom LED matrix kit, and all the fixins to get started, plus training on how
to program it. Register today or miss out!

Sounds like a really neat workshop, but I don't really have a cashflow at the
moment... Have you bought all the hardware for this already?

I believe the situation was that he needed to order the boards by last night and
if he didn't get enough sign ups to cover the shipping costs he was going to
cancel it and not order anything.

Anyone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

That would be... Unfortunate.
