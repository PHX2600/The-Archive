## Web developer position open...
Posted by **Valveritas** on Sat August 22nd, 2009 09:30:07 PM

I thought I'd check to see if any of you guys would like to redesign my website, or parts of it.    Someone, like PHLAK, who has PHP experience and examples of his work online.  I have more money than time right now, so I'm willing to pay a discounted rate for this kind of service.  I just can't learn what I need to know in the time I have.   You don't need to do everything at once, nor do you need to do everything I require.  

The site as is:

Here's what I need briefly:

[list:2ibn3mer]
[*:2ibn3mer] A system of leaving comments for each entry and way to leave 'unofficial' links - possibly on the uploads.html page. [/*:2ibn3mer]

[*:2ibn3mer] A functional PHP Contact script. [/*:2ibn3mer]

[*:2ibn3mer] Ideally I could also use a front-end to allow me to add entries without having to use a clumsy HTML editor from the stone age.  Perhaps this same front-end could be used for everyone else as well. [/*:2ibn3mer]
[/list:u:2ibn3mer]

Anyone interested?   I would prefer if you're already an established member of this community btw.

Don't know how much extra time I'm going to have on my hands here, but for the sake of knowing and for others benefits as well, I'll ask a few questions?

1) Would a CMS or blogging package like WordPress (what this site uses) suffice for a back end for your site, or are you looking for something custom?

2) If a CMS or blogging package is sufficient, would you still want a unique front-end look or will a pre-designed theme be enough for you?

3) If a CMS or blogging package is sufficient and you're not looking for a unique front-end, are you still looking for someone to set it all up for you?

The answers to these questions will help determine the scope of the project which may influence myself (or others) to take or not take the job.  Thanks.

I'm unfamiliar with it, but that would probably suffice, as there's nothing special I'm looking for other than what I currently have and a way for the site to be more interactive / operational on its own.

Hard to say for sure, but I don't see why a pre-designed look couldn't work.  I imagine that would look better than what I'm doing currently.

Yes.  It may be elementary stuff, but it's not an area I've spent much time with.  <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

Hope these answers help.

Is this thread still open for PHP developer-hooker soliciation?  Or did you end up going the CMS route?

Nothing has changed.  I guess the only thing that has really changed is that I sort of gave up on getting anyone to work on it, and decided I would probably just have to bite the bullet and do it myself.... starting from scratch,  after Christmas or something.  

But other than that, yeah, it's still open.

Judging by the site functionality, I think Plone has you covered: [url:21w54w4a]http&#58;//plone&#46;org/[/url:21w54w4a]

An example of a Plone site: [url:21w54w4a]http&#58;//www&#46;delugphx&#46;org[/url:21w54w4a]

Thanks.  Looks like that could work and save a lot of time in the process.

I guess.

I also know a web developer that might be interested.  His rates are pretty reasonable.  PM me and I'll send his e-mail addy.
