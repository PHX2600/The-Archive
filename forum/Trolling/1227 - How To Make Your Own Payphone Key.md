20100403041128 &lt;MisterKeal&gt; Someone brought a payphone to the meet
20100403041136 &lt;MisterKeal&gt; ..and it jarred my memory
20100403041141 &lt;MisterKeal&gt; The dude was a jackass.
20100403041158 &lt;MisterKeal&gt; I told him how to open it, and he said &quot;I don't want to know how to open it, I want it opened.&quot;
20100403041220 &lt;MisterKeal&gt; &gt;:( that guy is pissing me off more and more each meet
20100403041253 &lt;MisterKeal&gt; I simply told him how to make his own fucking key and he had to be a douchebag.

You stated &quot;that guy is pissing me off more and more each meet&quot;. I assume you're talking about tjoseph since he's the one who brought the pay phone.  I have to ask how is that possible when that was his first time at a meeting in over a year (maybe a few years)?

Example: Kilo is one guy has been to phx2600 meet-ups regularly at-least since 2004, and you (PHLAK) and XlogicX still don't seem to know who he is.

Perhaps you should eat your shoe.

Just admit you have no clue what-so-ever what really goes on at your own monthly computer/radio/phone &quot;club&quot;. <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

btw, This was the April Fools Meet-Up this thread concerns, using such a key, the key would bend to crap instantly.

Happy April Fools.

(It was a real urban-legend from the 1980s, though, that you could simply angle bend a sardine can key along the length at 90 degrees in-order to use it to unlock a payphone.)

btw, the dude that brought the payphone was also at the meet prior and possibly the meet prior that, and I don't recall ever seeing at the meet any other time, and the March meet claimed it was his first 2600 meet ever.

You realize the guy used to kill people with crossbows for a living? Who would know, the guy can't even run full-out with 100+lbs under his arm like I can. Like wtf, &quot;really? you /really/ killed people with crossbows for a living, and you didn't even die just once with your puny physique?&quot;

UNLESS opcode/tjoseph is a magical fairy godmother that craps rainbows and snorts unicorn feces, I really have no idea where he gets this stuff.
