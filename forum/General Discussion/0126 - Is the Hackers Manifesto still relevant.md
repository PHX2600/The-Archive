## Is the Hackers Manifesto still relevant?
Posted by **alienkid** on Tue June 24th, 2008 02:58:58 AM

You know you have ADD when you start to post a new topic and an hour later you have 12 other tabs and still haven't finished the post.  XD
anyway

The movie Hackers on tv right now. It reminded me of back in the day when there were payphones to use my redbox on.  So my question is 20 years later, do you think the Hacker's Manifesto is still relevant?

Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.  &amp;quot;Teenager
Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering&amp;quot;...
        Damn kids.  They're all alike.

        But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain,
ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
        I am a hacker, enter my world...
        Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of
the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...
        Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.

        I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers explain
for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  &amp;quot;No, Ms.
Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in my head...&amp;quot;
        Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all alike.

        I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is
cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...
                Or feels threatened by me...
                Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
                Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
        Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.

        And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through
the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is
sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is
found.
        &amp;quot;This is it... this is where I belong...&amp;quot;
        I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to
them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...
        Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.  They're all alike...

        You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at
school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip
through were pre-chewed and tasteless.  We've been dominated by sadists, or
ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to teach found us will-
ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.

        This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and
you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek
after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color,
without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us
and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

        Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me
for.

        I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual,
but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.

I think the Hackers Manifesto is MORE relevant today then it was back then.  The only difference is true hackers are fewer and further between these days.  There are so many wanna be "hackers" that they don't even realize that what they are really trying to to is called cracking.

But those of us with the true hackers mindset will continue to exist.  We may not be in the news or on the front pages anymore, however, we're still around.  Maybe it's because we don't like the attention, or are too busy hacking to care, but we hackers must continue fighting for what we believe in, the one universal truth that sets us apart from every other human being... freedom.

War. War never changes...  <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: --> 

It's always going to be relevant!  Im not sure if its more relevant though... Every little modification or trick is being called a "hack" now a days ([http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=hacks&amp;x=0&amp;y=0](Amazon search for hacks brings up 159,580 results)).  I'm sure cultleadr has some good real world experience, I've just read a couple books on the 'good ol' days.  I bet if someone had access to credit records and telephone switches, the amount of power you had could defiantly corrupt a young person into doing things for the dirty money.

I wont even try and draw a line between 'hacking' and 'cracking'...

 BUT Even before the word hacker existed this was relevant, think about Socrates! He was forced to kill himself, and Galileo was another guy persecuted for his intellectual pursuits. As I said always relevant, the words change but the basic ideas are relativly static.

I distinctly remember a conversation with the Secret Service agent that once arrested me after my sentencing.  He said what I did was "what criminals do."  That always bugged me, and I didn't have an adequate response at the time.  It threw me off.  Well, I wasn't undermining society by collecting access codes to make phone calls.  And I wasn't making any money off that activity. Sure an argument can me made that what I did was illegal, like downloading copyrighted music, but that kind of indignation should be reserved for people that are truly doing harm by their actions. 

The public can be pretty ignorant, but overall I think hackers are perceived as heroes of the technological age by most.   Attempts by corporate government to demonize hackers has 
failed.  Hackers instill some dignity and purpose to what Ted Kaczynski railed against.  Obviously hackers don't want to be enslaved by technology.  With RFID tags, and other police state measures, that is the goal.  I suspect the importance of hackers will rise, not decrease.  There are bad elements in every community, as the media likes to focus on - but if it wasn't for hackers of all sorts, none of this would exist.

I semi disagree with cult. I don't feel hackers are yet veiwed as heros. The term hackers is now used for anyone who commits a crime based on technology and hackers are used a scapegoats. Just watch the free credit report.com commercials "some hacker stole my identity" that is a pretty broad comment. is there hackers that steal id information? yes, but is all id theft done by hackers? no. My friends dad refuses to pay bills online or do any online business whatsoever due to his fear of hackers stealing his info. I try to explain to him that writing a check or credit card information and sticking it in his mailbox is not safe either but he still feel that(for some reason) someone its easier for a hacker to steal info online then it is for someone to walk up and grab stuff out of his mailbox.
And on the scapegoat side m cousin found pics, info, phone numbers and the such of other women on her husbands lap top. According to him it wasn't him some hackers must have put it there. The question i told her to ask is WHY. Why would some random hacker go thru the trouble and time of taking over your husband computer just to make it appear he was messing around. In fact to me its seems more and more people are blaming hackers for wrong doing they do on there computers. Even a case in new york where some sick minded idiot is saying hackers are reponsible for the child porn and his online commuincation with childern in a sexual manner.
I try myself to explain to thoose that don't know the difference between a "hacker" and cyber criminal but hacker seems to be the term most used for such.
Now there are thoose educated ones out there that see hackers as the new frontier cowboys that help fight injustice and corruption in the age of information but i think theese people are few and far between. Yet they are growing.

Good points.  I may have been too optimistic in my previous post.  I do think the main enemy of progress toward hacker acceptance is the corporate-government media which influences the public.  If you strip that away, I think you'll find the average person tends to see hackers in a much better light.

I started using computers and back in the 80's with a TSR-80, and later a C64. While learning to program in basic and playing games, I never realized that I was on the road to hackerdom until I graduated High School. In high school, I was into web design and building computers. Had to restore my system many times after messing with the Windows OS. After High School, I started getting in to finding out how to break into systems to see what the truth was with all these people blaming Hackers on Data being lost or stolen. When I read the Manifesto, It was more like a check list of my life. People said I played Video Games too much. People got mad because I tied up the phone line. I then decided to continue my path. I went back to school and took Computer classes to further my programming and networking skills. I love learning new things about computers and science. But the manifesto was the first thing I read that described The way I always felt. It is relevant to anyone that feels like an outcast by others just because they like science, Technology, or whatever. Especially if the mainstream think this enthusiastic display of an interest is suspicious behavior.
