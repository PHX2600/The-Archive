## Amazon Lockers at 7-11
Posted by **ArchAngel** on Wed September 26th, 2012 08:27:43 AM

Apparently the idea is that you can get things delivered to an Amazon Locker at
a store (the article mentions pharmacies and 7-11 stores) instead of to your
haus, if, for example, you don't want it sitting outside all day waiting to get
stolen.

Here's a news article:

And, as always, the full text for archival purposes:

What's interesting is the interface where you just "punch in a code" -- surely
that's connected to the internet ... and while the obvious "hack" here would be
to use someone else's code to steal their stuff (not really in the hacker
spirit, in my mind), I was thinking more along the lines of being able to invent
a code so that you could stash something for later retrieval.

Any thoughts?
