## SPAM IPs
Posted by **PHLAK** on Mon November 15th, 2010 08:55:33 AM

This forum sees it's fair share of SPAM, and while there are measures in place to prevent it, we all know it's impossible to prevent it completely.  On that note, whenever some SPAM slips through the cracks, I will be posting the SPAMers IP address in the following list.  I will attempt to only add SPAM IPs and not trolls or other annoying people or flamers. I can't promise that this list will be perfect or kept up to date, but I'll do my best.

This list is a CSV in the format of `forum_user_name;email_address;ip_address` (those are back-ticks, the symbol to the left of the number 1).  Often time SPAMMERS use multiple IP addresses, so there may be duplicate user name/email addresses.

[code:10zbpn8r]
`xidoon;beeforum1@hotmail&#46;com;178&#46;79&#46;138&#46;59`
`xidoon;beeforum1@hotmail&#46;com;178&#46;79&#46;136&#46;24`
[/code:10zbpn8r]

Reminder, this forum does not condone taking potentially harmful action against anyone for any reason.  This list is for informational purposes only.  That being said, nobody like SPAMMERS.
