This happens once every couple years it seems like.

Maybe we should cycle back to borders.

So it appears yet another one of our meeting locations has gone belly up.  It was announced yesterday by Jargon and [http://twitter.com/dualisanoob/status/21009091003](confirmed today by Dual) that Unlimited Coffee  has closed it's doors for good.  That makes Unlimited the fourth venue to be hit by the "PHX2600 Curse" following Nick's Pizza, Cartel Coffee and The Willow House.  So here we go again, please make your suggestions and leave your comments for new meeting locations.

I haven't been to the new HeatSync Labs location (yet). There are a lot of positives to having it there (if we were able to do that).

However, one of the "negatives" is the location: Chandler (i.e. quite a bit more south and east of any locations thus far).


One of the things brought up at the DC Groups session was meeting locations. One meeting was held in the "banquet" room at a bowling alley. With the exception of "bowling league" events, the banquet room is unused (at this particular place, anyway). One would also assume that there is  wifi there.

There's a bowling alley at about 32nd Street and Indian School. I'll check them out and see if they have space/wifi, etc.

Everything Cartel makes is pure gold, but yeah, parking is meh, wifi is spotty, not really great for groups.

Lola closes early. :<  Like 8pm early.  Lola's Gold Spot location I think is open until 10pm or 11pm though (Roosevelt/3rd Ave).

Just talked to the board; Its possible but space is limited within HSL proper; Gangplank would need to ok it and add it to their schedule first, but I think they'd be ok with it.  Also, its in BFE downtown Chandler. :<

Other places that might be worth looking into:

* Conspire Coffee (open til' Midnight, also has an anarchist library), barely any indoor seating though. :/
* Phoenix Public Library (wifi, but no coffee allowed).
* Tempe Public Library (wifi AND coffee).

Pretty sure Lola closes at 10 or 11pm on Fridays.

Well the larger challenge is scoping where people actually go and can go. Downtown Phoenix if I recall correctly when we mapped it out is the "ground zero" of all of us. The group has grown, shifted and some people don't attend anymore. I think if we evaluate this we might be able to at least get an area general to all of us and move from there as to regions we can work with.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **PHLAK** on Fri August 13th, 2010 11:37:28 AM

By "ground zero" do you mean the most centralized location?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **TerrorDrone** on Fri August 13th, 2010 08:19:29 PM

due to my recent freedom i would like to go to more meetings now that the government isn't in my way. pretty sure i'm the farthest east of anyone else but will be moving more towards tempe within the year and since tempe is phoenix i wouldnt mind somewhere in the tempe central phoenix area

FFFFFFFUUUUUUU-

But yeah, Tempe would be cool, although if Lola's is closed late on Fridays I wouldn't mind that either since I'm in downtown Phoenix most Fridays.

Posted by **ThatGuy** on Fri October 8th, 2010 10:40:01 PM

I would suggest somewhere closest to the freeway. Unlimited was right in the middle of nowhere, and a pain in the ass from any side of town to get to especially during rush hour. Logistics will always be the deal maker when it comes to bringing people together from the Phoenix area. Sorry for the first post in a long time seemed the most relevant to issues at hand.

Until further notice, meetings will be held at Lola Coffee.  More details here: <http://www.phx2600.org/meeting-info/>

Fixing.  In the mean time, do you part and report the SPAM posts. Report is that little exclamation mark in a triangle button.

I just found you guys tonight and would like to go to a meeting.  There is a place called the Gelato Spot which is connected to a Hava Java.  They have wifi, patio seating, coffee and gelato in one spot.  <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->  Its on the NW corner of Camelback and 32nd St.
