I have a bunch of stuff to show but no formal presentation planned.

Who else is going? anyone presenting anything?

Any presentations planned?  I'd like to put something other than &quot;Cool stories, bros!&quot; in the [url=http&#58;//eventification&#46;com:px60cv8f]Eventification[/url:px60cv8f] event.

Ill do a brief demo of my project, 

show off some of its capabilities and answer any questions about its design.

that's something I guess.

Ok... I'll be there, though not sure for how long.  Sister-in-law's b-day dinner/party is that night as well, so my time at the meeting will be determined by that.

If someone is comfortable with IPTables, I'd appreciate a hand debugging an issue with dd-wrt isolating a secondary (public) SSID from the resources in the private network.

See the following link for the config information:

I'll bring the projector once again, in case we need it. Phlak, Kilo, will either of you have the &quot;screen&quot;?

@Rax I have little bit of experience with IP Tables and DD-WRT, so I'd be glad to offer a hand (and a brain [not that you can have my brain, just the ideas ^_^]).

I hear there's going to be a party at Unlimited this day, anyone want to crash it?

I'll be there, with the screen.

I wanted to ask that guy (the one who was playing Star Trek Online) if his cell phone data plan is still working.

Or ask if anyone else is into modding Dragon Age Origins.

I can relate that you can buy replacement Windows Vista Home Premium install discs from Hewlett Packard (laptops at least) for just the cost of shipping. $27 for overnight.

I'll be bringing an interesting little &quot;toy&quot; that I  got. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

I think I'll make it. I'm borrowing a friend's netbook until the end of the semester. So I need to load it up full of stuff.

Hey i'm the &quot;new guy&quot;...
Really wanted to go to this to see what it was all about but sadly my lil box with wheels has no engine, still waiting for the red-top SR20DET to arrive...
n-e ways, I think it might take a while so if anyone could help me out with a ride for next month's, i'd really appreciate it.
I'd want a ride for this one but i think tis a liddle too late :S

So yea, new to this lil sand box, just wanted to know what there is around me.
(never really lived in north america too long actually)

Welcome Syx!  I just opened up an April thread, I suggest posting in there for a ride to that meeting.  Hope you make it next month!
