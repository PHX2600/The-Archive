## BABY!!!
Posted by **PHLAK** on Fri June 19th, 2009 06:58:03 PM

In all the excitement and sleeplessness, I almost forgot to update you guys!  I'm a daddy!!!

Baby was breech and Rabbit (my wife) had low fluids, so we did Cesarean Section on the morning of June 9th and Kaylee Elizabeth was born at 9:55am.  She was 5lb 12oz and 17in long.

We should all be at the next meeting, however, the little one needs a handle.  Any ideas?

I don't believe in religion, but you can be one of her Darwin-Fathers if you'd like.  Or better yet, you can help me teach her all about the world of hacking!

better stop working for faith based money then

Congrats!  Are you going to start another one cooking?  The CREATOR just LOVES creating....

But seriously we don't want you to give up on faith based money, we need to keep watch from the top of a pyramid for as long as we can.

On the evening of July the 3rd, it has thus been chosen that my little girl's hacker handle shall be from that moment on &quot;Breach&quot; as in breaking in or gaining access too.

And on the full moon of her first menstrual cycle she's allowed to pick her own hacker handle!

First off - congrats! She is beautiful and I hope Sara's surgery healed well. 

As for the handle we have an old leash you could use instead...
