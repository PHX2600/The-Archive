## Transformer Houses
Posted by **ArchAngel** on Wed February 22nd, 2012 12:39:38 PM

Nar, not like Optimus Prime. Apparently in the 50s and 60s electrical companies
would put facades over substations so they'd look like hauses (Or ... Mouse =>
Mice, House => Hice?). Here's a link with some pictures:

And, as always, the text in case it goes down (for some reason):

> In 1987, Canadian photographer Robin Collyer began documenting houses that
> aren't houses at all – they're architecturally-disguised electrical
> substations, complete with windows, blinds, and bourgeois landscaping.
>
> "During the 1950s and 1960s," Collyer explains in a recent issue of Cabinet
> Magazine, "the Hydro-Electric public utilities in the metropolitan region of
> Toronto built structures known as 'Bungalow-Style Substations.' These
> stations, which have transforming and switching functions, were constructed
> in a manner that mimics the style and character of the different
> neighborhoods."
>
> Simulacra meant to reflect how it looks to be domestic and Canadian, "there
> are about 100 of these structures located on residential streets in the
> central and the suburban parts of the greater Toronto area." Pictured here are
> only five of them. So if you live in suburban Toronto and your neighbor's
> house is humming – perhaps now you know what's really going on inside.
>
> Meanwhile, the address 555 Spadina – i.e. the third image, above – shows up in
> this list of 322 properties owned by the city of Toronto. If anyone out there
> knows something about the other 321 buildings, be in touch!


Here's a link from the article to the work of Robin Collyer:

I have previously seen pictures of an (abandoned?) oil rig being disguised as a
building:

And I'm sure everyone's probably heard of cell fone and radio towers being
disguised as trees, but just in case:

But, yar, transformers disguised as multi-level homes is a new one to me. O_o!

Very cool! I haven't heard of that either, thanks for sharing.  I also love the
pictures of cellphone towers disguised as trees, I know there is one in a church
cross near my old house.

His light shines (and carries your texts!)

Those cell towers look horrible too. Reminds me of the picture that you drew for
my stego presentation :), you can totally tell it's not a tree.
