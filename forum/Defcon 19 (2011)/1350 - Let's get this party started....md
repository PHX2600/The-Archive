## Let's get this party started...
Posted by **PHLAK** on Mon December 13th, 2010 09:07:46 AM

I thought I'd get the ball rolling a bit early, who's planning on attending Defcon 19 and how are you planning on getting there?  I'm planning on going, especially since they moved out of the Riv (that place got way to crowded).  I'll likely be driving up with the wife (and maybe kid) and if I have any extra room in my car will offer people a ride.

I think I'm going to try and get my employer to pay for it this year since its related to my job now.

I missed not going last year.

Definitely going. My wife may come too. We've flown in the past, since she doesn't like the drive to Vegas.

I may do this this year if we can find a good price.  Know anywhere I can get a good deal?

already talked to the boss into paying for it this year as a research trip

I'll likely be going, but probably flying in this time.

You're going to give up a sweet 5 hour journey with friends to be poked and prodded by the TSA?

Brave man.

yea... that's a good point. TSA honestly makes me want to drive. Especially since I bring a lot of material to Defcon that gets me weird looks. Like lockpicks, bare circuit boards, and stuff with hacker stickers on them.

Southwest is usually the cheapest. They have $55 one way per person tickets. For two people, two ways, that makes $220. Driving usually takes one tank of gas each direction. So for me that's about $70 total. $150 difference for the convenience? Possibly worth it.

(Plus my father-in-law works at Southwest, so sometimes we'll get free tickets.)

Good point.  That and the price AltF4 quoted are making me think I wont be flying.

Eh, if I drive next year, the drive would be much more than 5 hours, more on that soon...

Bah, I got a pistol on board last time: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7848683">http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?secti ... id=7848683</a><!-- m -->
... but for real, I was flying to LA for EDC and my friend brought his &quot;tobacco pipe&quot; wrapped in a sock with his carry on... it got x-ray'd, pulled aside and TSA opened up the toiletries bag he was hiding it in said:
&quot;You can't have toothpaste over 4oz, but that's fine...&quot; -- even touched the wacky pipe in the sock... probably knew what it was and were just giving him a bit of a mind fudge... and we moved on through.  I have other stories of &quot;friends&quot; involving sheets upon sheets of 'stuff' being overlooked very easily, even using a strip of 'stuff' as a bookmark and carrying it on in plain sight, but driving is fun cause you can blast &quot;chamillionaire - ridin' dirty&quot; going through the dam check points  <!-- s:x --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /><!-- s:x -->

So the wife and I are definitely going, and definitely driving. We're gonna head out Thursday night after we get out of work, and leave back for Phoenix Sunday. 

We haven't yet actually booked rooms at the Rio, but we will this Friday I think. But check this out: The Buffet of Buffets. 
<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.harrahs.com/buffets/faq.html">http://www.harrahs.com/buffets/faq.html</a><!-- m -->

$50, and you get 24  hours of unlimited buffet access, at all 7 Harras buffets. Sounds worth it to me.

Here in Vegas at the Embassy Suites. Managed to extract the &quot;complimentary&quot; wireless access key entered by the desk manager this morning so We're set for the duration of our stay.

Anyone interested in meeting up at some point?

Party over <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( -->
It was aight, we need to let burning man and defcon fuck and make a little baby that isn't as big as either of those monsters.  So impersonal, so many ... lamers... sorry for being so elitist, but goddamn it I think I'VE even forgot how to have fun.
