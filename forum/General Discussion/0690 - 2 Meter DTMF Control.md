## 2 Meter DTMF Control
Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Mon December 8th, 2008 10:47:28 AM

Just some updates,

Started working on a DTMF link for my radio with the ultimate goal of being able to place and receive calls on it, heres some video to please your eyes and brain.

this method could be used to control just about anything over the radio, get information, make phone calls, issue a command, use your imagination...

And it doesn't cost me $100 a month either... ahem.

Awesome!

Ideas:

1) Text to speech program to read back things (google results, phone #'s, driving instructions...)
2) Interface with skype seems like it would be the next step, good for outgoing calls from the handi talkie, just have to figure out an "over" system...
3) Home automation

MORE IDEAS

Ideas!

just got text to speech working, now it can read me all sorts of data on command

I even figured out how to time the correct PTT length so it doesn't get cut off or transmit for too long.
