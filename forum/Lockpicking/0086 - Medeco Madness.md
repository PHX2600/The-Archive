## Medeco Madness

I finally got my hands on an M3, so lets see how long it takes me to pick this
bad boy. As of now I can only pick the 5 pin with a little luck and lots of
beer. Every time I change the pin stack it is a new lock all over again which =
another 12pk of lager. Time is on my side so lets see what America's best has to
offer. I think the DCAP hook should be up to the task.

Have any of you guys had luck with Medeco's?
