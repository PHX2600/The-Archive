Posted by **jargon** on Sun December 21st, 2008 10:10:34 PM

My lil' brother looked at the ingredients for a candy cane he was eating:

>  * Sugar
>  * Corn Syrup
>  * Titanium-Dioxide
>  * Peppermint Flavoring
>  * Red #40

Okay, do any of these ingredients sound a little freaky?

Maybe they just want it to last forever, like a Twinkie or something.
