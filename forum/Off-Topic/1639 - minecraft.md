Yeah, there's a #minecraft channel on irc.2600.net. But more importantly, a couple of &quot;2600&quot; minecraft servers. I've been playing on brain.ratman.org (r0d3nt's server). It's very light on mods, which I prefer, though it does have a really cool mod that ties the in-game chat together with #minecraft on IRC. Just PM r0d3nt in IRC to get whitelisted.

Never play minecraft before? they now have a free demo (only lasts 100 minutes) that is fully featured (instead of just creative mode).
Oh, the game works in Linux too.
