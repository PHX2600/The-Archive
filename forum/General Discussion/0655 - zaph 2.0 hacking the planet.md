## zaph 2.0 hacking the planet
Posted by **taryn** on Mon November 17th, 2008 01:23:02 PM

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2DS8PxKJAQ](this is baby david) rocking out to "hack the planet" which is a song from hackers 2 which i've never seen but everyone seems to think it sucks because there's no angelina in it.

the song is pretty lame itself but david likes the beat. a friend said that he is going to be fun to party with in 20 years. mattie says he is a raver.

sorry i'm spamming a baby video but it's a neat video that even anti-baby people have liked!

HAHAHA!  Just wait, once PHLAK Jr. comes we'll have baby rave competitions!

In regards to Hackers 2, it's actually called "Takedown."  The movies isn't even by the same people who did Hackers, and was never intended to be "Hackers 2."  The movie is is based on a book about the pursuit and capture of Kevin Mitnick, and is a fantastic movie.  The tile "Hackers 2: Takedown" was an informal title given to it by the community, and I don't know why people insist on calling it Hackers 2.

oh.. ok. i really had no idea and dont pretend to. it was a kazaa file from back in the day labeled something like "hack the planet - hackers 2 soundtrack." i only just saw hackers for the first time a couple of weeks ago. jason was trying to talk me out of it saying it wasn't that good. and it wasn't...

Yeah, that "Hackers 2" movie was kind of weird.

i watched it a couple weeks ago. zaph told me that mitnick was fat but of course the guy who played him wasnt. i dunno. didn't the actor who played him have a creepy pedo mustache? we actually didn't finish the movie, lol. i got really bored because it kept just repeating shit we already knew. it was interesting at first because he did stuff and then got caught but it just kept hammering the point home so we turned it off. i am sometimes picky about movies.
