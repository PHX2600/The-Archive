What OS is the client machine running? What wireless adapter is it using? What driver version does that have loaded? Have you made any modifications to the router that might effect wifi? (Is it running a custom firmware,etc.)

i dont think its the machine as it is happening on both winxp and ubuntu machines pretty much any wirelesss device while downloading &gt;30Mb i think maybe my routers wifi is just crap and need to get a new one 
havent modded the firmware or hardware on it 
after a little more reseerch it appears to be a common problem with linksys cable gateways

Have you tried updating the router's firmware?  Sometimes that helps it work better on the inside

What model router are you using?  What firmware version is installed and is it factory or custom?  And are you using any encryption?
