Has anyone ever noticed that Google web mail doesn't send an originating IP address?  I've been looking at some emails, and I've seen several examples of this. Here's one:

Has it always been like this, or am I missing something here?

I've heard it mentioned in a few spam discussions; it would seem it's always been like that.
