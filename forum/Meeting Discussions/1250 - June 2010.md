Hey all! 

I'm finally done with school, and now hope to make the meetings far more regularly now. Not coincidentally, I've got some projects left over that some of you may be interested in that I'd like to show off at the meeting / get recruits for in coding. 

There's three, all of which I'll elaborate on in more detail in the meeting I'm sure:

1) (My Master's Thesis) A Wi-Fi protocol for secure Internet access in public hotspots. I have a proof-of-concept that works, but I'd love to make it more featured, useful, and integrated.
2) An automated tool for bypassing MAC filtering on Wi-Fi networks. (IE: Jumping over paywalls) Right now it's just a Bash script. I'd really like to integrate it into NetworkManager... And it also needs some general improvements.
3) Protocol detection / evasion tools. This one probably takes a little explaining. But it's pretty sweet. I've hardly done any work on it yet, aside from a crude proof-of-concept. 

That said, this won't constitute as a "presentation" So someone else should sign up for that job. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> I just wanted to throw it out there that I'm looking for some help if any of these things sound interesting to you. If it does, come hit me up.

Later!

All of the above sound pretty awesome,

I'm most interested in your bash script mac filter bypass because that sounds pretty hacked together to me.

I'm not sure if ill be at the next meeting or not, but if i am i might have a few things to show off. No presentation worthy material yet though.

Not sure if I'll be at this meeting yet.  It's the same day as my dads birfday.
