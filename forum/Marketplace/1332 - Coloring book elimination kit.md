What kind of shape is it in? Do you think it'd make a good gift for a kid?

I'll bring it to the meet,

It is slightly used some of the pencils are shorter than others and stuff.

I'm gonna try and sell all this stuff off and put the money aside for DARC but if your giving it as a gift for a kid I'll let you have it.

It's good to do nice things for kids!
