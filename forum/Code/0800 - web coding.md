what if any advantages does php have over html
or vice versus

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not an HTML expart but I'm pretty sure the main advantage of PHP over HTML is being interactive and dynamic, 

PHP can dynamically generate pages using data from a back end and can also store/retrieve user data from a database or other external locations like MySql or what have you, html just sits there all static like and doesn't do much D:


yep.

*edit*

php also gives you +1 geek pointz 
but it costs your server -10% CPU time

HMM guessi'm leaning towards php as i need the geek points

Yeah, I've been toying with php and sql lately. PHP is your C++ for the web. You want to know some html as well though, because your php will be generating a lot of it. I find it odd to compare the two though, html is more of a formatting language, where as php is more of a programming language (though some may still call it a scripting language). It would be like having a programming language that could generate Word documents, you still want to know how Word documents are formatted at the back end too. The other interesting thing about PHP is that it is server side, so it is a web server running it. You would either want some remote hosting, or you would want to set up a web server (you can even do this locally on your machine and just use 127.0.0.1). Something stupid easy to get you up and running with all of that is xampp; it installs a web server for you with php and sql already configured.

Yeah deff, xampp and lamp are worth checking out. They turn an hour or more worth of work setting up Apache PHP and MySql into like 30 seconds.

From what I've read, to use PHP one must have some knowledge of HTML

It definitely helps; PHP works with HTML as output and can receive input from HTML forms, not just can it, but it is the most common. This post is generated by PHP: The post is actually in a MySQL database and the PHP code processes and formats the page into the HTML your browser is displaying.

PHP is your coding language.  With PHP you can access and utilize databases, do complex math/logic problems, and otherwise &quot;program&quot; a web application with it.

HTML on the other hand is strictly for generating a web pages layout and look (along with CSS).  HTML is the display/design side of things.

What he said.  If you want a tower-and-sniper-rifle level of head hurting though, just do everything in JavaScript and skip the PHP.   <!-- s:shock: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><!-- s:shock: -->

What, if any, are the advantages of having a brewery over having a beer?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **XlogicX** on Sat September 5th, 2009 12:11:24 AM

The brewery can process ingredients server side and produce a costum beer product with user input functionality. Also, owning a brewery is more exiting than having a beer when you don’t drink.

The question I would ask is, what advantages
does JavaScript have over PHP and vice versa?  Secondly, which is more more secure (or less 'hackable')?

PHP is server side, meaning that all code is processed by the server before handing anything to the user, and therefor fairly secure if coded properly.  JavaScript is completely client side, meaning that all code is processed by the users browser after being handed to the user, and therefor completely insecure.  This is insecure because the user can choose to change the way the JavaScript is interpreted, insert or delete any code or even choose not to run it at all.  On the other hand, with PHP, the user has no say in the matter of whether or how the code is processed.  When the user makes a request to the server for a page, all PHP code is processed on the server BEFORE being sent to the user, preventing virtually all interactions.

That explains why Evil1 often had those javascript hacks in the past.   But then there's the SQL injections, so I wasn't really sure which was more or less secure.

W3schools seems to recommend learning the basics of JavaScript before learning PHP.  Would you agree with that, or is possible to just skip javascript altogether?

I learned a lot of PHP before ever touching JavaScript.  I don't think it would be out of the ordinary for someone to be great at PHP and to have never touched JavaScript or visa-versa.  However, I think they compliment each other very well and would encourage you to learn both.  But neither is required or even desired before learning the other.  They both server very different purposes.

As a personal recommendation, I'd suggest hopping right into the PHP.  PHP will probably take longer to learn and is more broad/powerful.

uh oh sounds like Ajax incoming.

JavaScript combined with PHP has the potential to become a thing called AJAX which actually stands for &quot;Asynchronous Javascript and XML&quot; but really means &quot;TOTALLY BADASS&quot;, with Ajax you can make asynchronous calls to your server for data which allows you to make totally insane awesome interfaces which normally would only be possible on a purely client side application.

For example: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://chiptune.com/">http://chiptune.com/</a><!-- m -->

AJAX is like + 15 geek points and is surprisingly easy when combined with libraries such as JQuery.

@Phlak:  Yeah, I was thinking of focusing mainly on PHP originally.  There are so many things I want to do where PHP would come in handy.   Thanks for the perspectives on this, it helps.
