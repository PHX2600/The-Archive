## Postal Quandry
Posted by **Valveritas** on Tue June 14th, 2011 01:32:55 AM

What on earth do you have to do to get the post office to return a package to the sender without actually refusing it?  Supposedly, they return packages if you don't pick it up within 15 days.  It's been over 30 and it's still at the post office.   You see, if I refuse the package I may be charged a substantial re-stocking fee of around $500 from the business I ordered the item from.  <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( -->

I don't understand.  The company sent you a package that you don't want?  If that's the case, why not just decline it from the post office?

As far as I know a 'decline would be the same thing as a refusal. Are you saying there is a difference? ** A refusal means the company may perceive my order as a cancellation, and may be subject me to strict re-stocking fees. **   I'm trying to avoid that.  I expected the post office to return the package to the sender by now as undelivered, per their policy, but they are just holding onto it out of laziness or some other reason.  If the package never returns to the sender I can't really get my money back.

I figured there might be a slim possibility someone might have a solution to this, that doesn't result in me losing money or being forced to own something I don't want.

I gotcha now. Unfortunately I don't know of any way around this. If you actually placed this order (which I assume you did), then you're responsible for shipping costs and any restocking fees.  I admit I wouldn't want to pay the restocking fee if I was in your situation, but you are costing the company time/money.  At this point you have to decide which is worse, never getting your money back or a restocking fee.

I would've canceled the order, but they have a draconian cancellation policy.  They are actually costing me more time and money, so it's not exactly fair.

You just can't rely on anybody to do the right thing so you can do the wrong thing these days. 'Tis a shame.

you should've let the package come through (and then pooped in the box, and sent it back)
