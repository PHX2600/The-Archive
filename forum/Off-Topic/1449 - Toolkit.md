## Toolkit
Posted by **tokiya** on Wed August 31st, 2011 04:19:33 AM

I need a recommendation on tool kits for pc/laptop repair.  I've gone to Frys and looking online at toolkits for pc repair and I want to get a good kit so I can work on computers at home but don't want to buy crappy quality tools that are gonna break.  Would you buy individually or have you seen a good quality, &quot;complete&quot; kit?

To start with your last question, I'd definitely buy separately.  I've never seen a single good/complete PC repair toolkit.

Now, as for what I think you need for PC building/repair, the tools I've found come in hand are:

[*:afvo7ss7] A standard Philips head screwdriver[/*:m:afvo7ss7]
[*:afvo7ss7] A few mini Philips and flat-head screwdrivers (for laptops)[/*:m:afvo7ss7]
[*:afvo7ss7] A pair of needle nose pliers (bitches love needle nose pliers)[/*:m:afvo7ss7]
[*:afvo7ss7] A soldering iron and solder (mostly for reconnecting broken power ports on laptops)[/*:m:afvo7ss7][/list:u:afvo7ss7]

Other than that, having some miscellaneous HDD and case screws around is nice  also miscellaneous cables.  There's not much else you really need when it comes to PC repair.  But there's something you often find yourself needing, go out and get it.  I also have a toolbox for these tools and screws and other miscellaneous parts.

Yep, Steve Wozniak just goes around to restaurants and tweets about it on 4square... people don't actually ~build computers~ anymore (unless you're Jerri Ellsworth)

Yeah, I never really liked those pre-packaged toolkits, I only really every used the screw driver and maybe some pliers out of it. For computer repair, I can't really think of much else, even soldering isn't really the necessary any more (though it's good to have an iron for other stuff, but I wouldn't use one of the ones that come with the kit).

beyond that, maybe a first aid kit for when you cut yourself on the insides of a computer, I'm sure I'm not the only one that has bleed from computer repair, tugging on those old stubborn IDE ribbons.

I christen all my new PCs with my own blood.
