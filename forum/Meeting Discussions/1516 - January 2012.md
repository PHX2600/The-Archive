I'll also be bringing my locks and "tools," it's always a fun activity...I miss ThatGuy.

I hope to be there.  Nothing really planned on my end though.

For the lazy, run this before the command I listed in the first post here. If there are questions, ask. If anybody figures out just what the hell I'm talking about, post it (for the benefit of the lazier).

[code:q9judfv3]sudo apt-get install outguess[/code:q9judfv3]

I think you should present xlogicx, I love the concept of stego stuff!
Even though I don't really use it...
Cool to see a steganography tool in the repos like that though.

Anyway, just download the picture, run the command(from the same directory) and you should get a nice little text file with a message in it  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D --> 

I might do some arts for logic's pres too wheeee

Hacker yard sale next meeting!

Bring all your unused treasures and some cashhhh.

I'll be bringing all sorts of goodies..

A couple laptops, a PDA, some cell equipment, pc expansion cards, beige boxing equipment, a joystick, portable screens, embedded Dev equipment, all sorts of awesome stuff.

See you there.

Confirmed with Rax about the project, Stego presentation is on for tomorrow  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D --> 

And NAKs art totally polishes the sideshow; exactly what I was looking for.

Wow. tomorrow already? Sheesh... I'll probably be there

You better be there, I'm interested in your other related project.

Specs on laptops?

I'm bringing 2x MSI 8800GT's OC'd and a Cable modem.   <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

Presentation has been posted on main page. Code included for whitespace and brainfuck, also included a commented version for each. The presentation (.ods) has notes if you view it in the notes view, with references to conference talks, books, and white-papers where appropriate.

Enjoy, and thanks for listening.

If you want the footage... the shooting or A/V quality isn't that good but here it is anyway: <http://mindsforge.com/pres.7z>

Thanks for the vid Nak, I like it when I'm like "oh, I didn't select whitespace?" and you zoom into where the webpage has C++ obviously selected, lol. I think it was mostly just the audio that sucked, and there's not a whole hell of a lot that can be done about it in that environment.

I've actually been adding slides, lol. I actually plan to do something else/more with this. But thanks to ALTF4 for asking about the details of the image stego. Mostly, SDS and TDS are used (Spatial Domain Steganography and Transform Domain Steganography). OutGuess is TDS and Steghide is SDS, to answer that question. Not sure on Transform yet, but as far as Spacial....:

Assume the pixel data is RGB with one byte for each color (web color codes anyone?). I have no idea what jpg uses (I will eventually, looks like), but just please assume my version for this explanation <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->. If we just wiped out the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of every single pixel, and replaced it with our own binary data, we could have the recovery of the data only get a stream of the LSB's. This would not change the file size at all. Technically it would only affect the Blueness; as it's the last of the 3 bytes that make a pixel. How much does it affect the blueness? 1 byte, dude, that's 256 shades of blue, and your only changing the LSB of those 8 bits, which changes the blueness by 1/256th of a shade.

To beat this dead horse, I'm going to embed my favourite ASCII character again (notice the difference in colors side by side):

This is perfect XlogicX! Very clear with the visual demo.

Yea! That's awesome. Thanks.

I know that one of the best Steganographic techniques that was mentioned in the crypto classes at ASU was the use of the Image Least Significant Bit steganography plus standard encryption. The LSB of compressed images will be high entropy (essentially random bits) which is what encrypted data also is. So it's actually indistinguishable (from an Information theory persepctive) from a normal image's high entropy LSB's. Which means that the Stego works even if the attacker looks at the LSB's of the image. He also has to know the encryption key to even know that there was a hidden message.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yeah, there's not a whole lot you can do. Even if the most common methods were LSB of a pixel or even LSB or R, G, and B separately. Without encryption, you could carve the LSB's out of all jpgs and inspect...and maybe find something if you know the exact technique. But with encryption (which you should use anyway), carving a normal image and an encrypted stego image should look indistinguishable. The main reason none of my examples have encryption is because it's so much easier to explain in a visual way.

Great conversations.
