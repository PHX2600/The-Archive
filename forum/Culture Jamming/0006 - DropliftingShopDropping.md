## Droplifting/ShopDropping

This is a good article on Droplifting:

And just in case it goes down:

[b:2u7xrnyn]Shopdropping aka Droplifting: Beginner’s Guide to the Subversive Art of Reverse Shoplifting[/b:2u7xrnyn]

[url=&quot;http://www.shopdropping.net/&quot;]Shopdropping[/url] was probably the last kind of giving on most people’s minds as they shopped during the holiday season. Shopdropping, also known as droplifting, is the incredible act of reverse shoplifting: going into stores and putting things onto the shelves. Banksy is [url=&quot;http://weburbanist.com/2007/07/19/banksy-paradox-unofficial-guide-to-the-worlds-most-infamous-urban-guerilla-street-artist/&quot;]probably the best known shopdropper[/url], famous for putting out his own [url=&quot;http://weburbanist.com/2007/07/26/subvertising-5-ways-to-take-control-and-subvert-your-surroundings/&quot;]subvertised[/url] versions of Paris Hilton’s CDs and hanging his subversive art in galleries.

Shopdroppers have their own reasons for [url=&quot;http://www.discorder.ca/oldsite/features/03octdroplift.html&quot;]doing what they do[/url]. Some are [url=&quot;http://weburbanist.com/2007/10/08/culture-jamming-political-commercial-and-social-signs-of-our-times/&quot;]social and political culture jammers[/url] who want to raising awareness about consumerism or adding warnings to dangerous products. Others seek to promote their own product, such as an [url=&quot;http://www.thedeathofjasonbrody.com/&quot;]album left in a record store[/url]. Still others do it for their own amusement and artistic fulfillment without expectations of any kind of return.

Some shopdrop projects are individual endeavors while others are the work of highly organized groups, such as the Droplift Project. The [url=&quot;http://www.droplift.org/&quot;]Droplift Project[/url] takes found sound and turns it into an audio collage to create “new art, social commentary, parody and contemporary criticism.” [url=&quot;http://www.shopdropping.net/pages/menu.html&quot;]Ryan Watkins-Hughes[/url] of ShopDropping.net adds his own labels to commercial products simply as a form of self-expression.

It might not surprise you to learn that reactions to shopdropping or droplifting vary as much as approaches to it and reasons for doing it. Some people find it harmless and amusing while others find it shocking and disturbing. Shopdroppers who are caught are variously freed by confused police or held on charges related to destruction of property or even fraud. Reactions, criticisms or other shopdropping thoughts?

Wow, that sounds great, there are so many things that can be done with this, I can't beleive that I havn't tought of it before. We can even print out barcodes that will ring up as something else if someone tries to purchase the product (assuming that it is not in the stores database, and that is a good assumption). If the checker doesn't notice (funny either way), then the consumer may actually be able to pay money for it. Although the store gets the profit, it is still bad on their inventory. Wow, I'm going to let this one boil for a bit.

Ive mentioned a movie on the old board called &quot;The Yes Men&quot; there was a short section on this, even though there was no hip name associated with the act.

To summarize:
They bought GI Joe talking toys and Barbie talking toys, switched the voice circuits and then placed them back on the shelf covertly.  Lulz ensued.

I did a copycat prank at Radioshack were I took the sound board out of a returned truck toy and put it in a mobile phone demo where they had talking caller ID, it now plays some rock music  <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

I think most big-box stores have telxon guns - some of which, at least, have the power to alter inventories. It might be worth downloading a manual for one of the more popular models in the PHX and then scanning your barcode into the system for added legitimacy. Doubly humourous for whomever has to go back out the change from the database, that way - &quot;Looks like we have thirteen hundred thirty seven of these things in the store somewhere, Paul!&quot;. *grinz*

Hey, culture jamming (like any hacking) can have political motivation, too. Maybe rewire some barcodes to scan as &quot;RonPaul&quot; and price them at &quot;$20.08&quot;? Logic would probably be able to tell you more about building custom barcodes than I could. ^_-.

Unfortunately, I couldn't think of many ways to do that. A bar code is pretty much just a 12 digit number. The bar code number for a 12oz can of Mt Dew is the same number at albertsons as it is at frys. So that also means that the price is not inherently stored on the barcode either, it is determined by the store. I'm just refering to the UPC kind though, you could probably do what your refering to with a code-128 barcode, at least in text.

It would be worth it just to do that to a store.it'd be fun to change out dvds too, does anyone have a shrink wrapper?

Posted by **phigan** on Sun December 30th, 2007 05:16:17 PM

There's botnet potential in this, kinda...

Package up a CD with pictures of games all over it.. Promise all kinds of crap, it doesn't really matter.. then put a 99cent pricetag and the UPC of some bubblegum/candy on it.. Stick it next to the DVDs by the front or in a checkout line.

What's on the CD? Random evil backdoors and things, of course.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **PHLAK** on Sun December 30th, 2007 06:18:56 PM

Sounds like something my friends and I thought up after hearing about the Nine Inch Nails music on thumb drives left in restrooms.  Leave random thumb drives around with GonZor's Payload on them and have it email what it logs to you.  I'd be willing to bet more than a few people are dumb enough to open random thumb drives on work computers.

Posted by **XlogicX** on Mon December 31st, 2007 06:10:58 AM

We could also have a live linux CD with many tools, something like Knoppix-STD.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Medicine Storm** on Wed January 2nd, 2008 11:17:39 AM

Knoppix is not a bad idea. If we want quasi-political motivation, why not promote a free alternative to expensive software, like ubuntu next to the windows vista boxes, GIMP next to the Photoshop boxes, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **nak** on Wed January 2nd, 2008 03:08:31 PM

Penguin and I did the Ubuntu next to the windows boxes at compusa, when they were still open.  <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

Posted by **XlogicX** on Thu January 3rd, 2008 09:40:24 AM

We could do a phx2600 branded version of knoppix, and put some of our favorite tools in, or just have a standard STD like version. We could also put links to our favorite (but relevant) websites in the firefox favorites or something. It could be a way to whore ourselves out and get more people to show up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **PoH** on Thu January 3rd, 2008 03:47:56 PM

Sounds like quite the plan. Some friends and I had been thinking about putting porn in DVD's and game cases at wal-mart because, well, wally world is the devil... but this sounds like a much better idea. Let me know and if something does come of this if I could get a copy of the disk I will make more copies and spread them over here in Chandler.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **phigan** on Sat January 5th, 2008 10:16:23 AM

Just make it softporn.. Don't put like 2girls1cup in a Hello Kitty box. You don't want to traumatize the children.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **PoH** on Thu January 10th, 2008 05:46:06 PM

No, the way I figured it, and would hope it would go down as such that the parents would open the package, recognize the nakedtivity on the disc then go and complain at wal-mart... So on and so forth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Medicine Storm** on Fri January 11th, 2008 08:44:20 AM

Yes, but what is our goal? the degridation of wal-mart's reputation or the promotion of open-source's/Anti-The-Man reputation. I think a kid getting ahold of porn from wal-mart would affect both reputations negatively here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **PoH** on Sat January 12th, 2008 10:25:18 AM

Quite true, and sorry, yeah, I am an ex wal-mart employee, I was thinking more of ruining reputations then anything... that's why I suppose I hopped in on this though was this looked like a much better idea then mine, simply from a moral point of view.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Medicine Storm** on Mon January 14th, 2008 09:27:22 AM

Oh, don't get us wrong. Destructing the reputation of (one of) the largest and scheming-est corporations ever is a good thing. After all, this is the Culture Jamming forum, I was only looking for the most [i:xiurqz57]effective[/i:xiurqz57] culture jam. We are white-hat, but morals were not our motivation here. We wanted to hit all the big expensive software companies as well as the big retail stores at the same time as drawing positive attention to ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **PoH** on Tue January 15th, 2008 12:19:25 AM

Well, as afore mentioned, if I can get a copy of a LiveCD or something we would like to use I and a few local friends are more then willing to copy them and do our part out on this side of town (Chandler, East Mesa). I can more then likely recruit a sleugh (I think that's right?) of people to help out.

P.S.: I like the idea of the freedom of speech bit being added into this, mayhap making a collaborative video, getting ahold of ZeitGeist (If you haven't seen it, the entire movie -2 hours- is on Google Videos, go watch it) and putting it in their, but also, not just freedom of speech but freedom of...well, freedom.

I think either 'slew' or 'slue', depending on what part of the country you're from. ^_-. &lt;/not that it matters since we understood anyway&gt;

I'm actually pretty interested in developing a common package to drop off - it seems more coordinated, and it's more likely to draw attention to it than several independent developments - putting yourself in the shoes of J. Random Shops-At-Wal-Mart, I think it'd have a bigger WTF factor to have several copies of the PHX2600 Distro in nice boxes (maybe even with price tags that read something like &quot;FREE (your mind)&quot;) right next to the windoze and adobe ones on the shelf - probably the biggest challenge would be keeping them stocked. It might also be fun to do this at a Best Buy or one of those stores where they are likely to have boxed software displayed prominently at the end of an aisle - hijacking an entire store display is a pretty damn cool way to jam culture, since it takes all the work of putting something out prominently and rewires it to our advantage. Again, just my ¥200 though. ^_-.

I like the ideas, but I can't really see a security distribution being that useful to the public.  I also don't see why image is important if shopdropping is done anonymously, the only time when 'hacker/phreak' reputation could get damaged is if the dropper gets caught and says something along the lines of &quot;I was doing this for phx2600.org! They're hackers, they tricked me!&quot; during questioning.  It would be an individuals reputation that would be damaged, unless we started putting porn dvds in children's movies sharpied with our URL or 'hack the planet!&quot;.

I don't think a free OS next to the windows boxes will make a big deal, it did not when I worked at compusa, and I don't see any sort of attention (positive or negative) to any community or individual if it were carried out.

If you wanted to be more of an open source activist and less prankster, you could even call up the store and ask the manager if it was cool to put up your distro.

If you guys haven't heard of looked up what banksy has actually, I suggest googling him, his executions were entertaining!

How about in the spirit of &quot;more prankster&quot;, we see some ideas on how to get Apple?

We disagree. If Mr. J. Shops-At-walmart is presented with something that enlightens him and make his life easier/more enjoyable while at the same time reveals how corrupt walmart is, then Mr. Shops-At-walmart will shout for more and seek further enlightenment.
However, if Mr. J. Shops-At-walmart is presented with something that entertains his penis, while at the same time corrupts the minds of his children (funny!), then Mr. Shops-At-walmart will shout for the evil hackers to be crucified. If you think the media would attribute this to the individuals who execute it and not use it to reinforce the &quot;evil dweeb hackers that can't get laid so they act infantile and ruin everything for no reason&quot; image, then you haven't been watching the news enough.

If we distribute something that is shocking and offensive (albeit hilarious) as opposed to shocking and enlightening, we will be painted as the evil empire as opposed to the righteous rebel alliance. Do not assume this could not be linked to phx2600.org

We guess the real question is, do we care?

We have seen banksy's work. His work is very well executed. However, even the authorities felt a subtle air of respect for his pranks. The pranks were shocking, but tasteful. Illegal, but enlightening. We noticed even the museum curators, who were his victims, were not overly enthusiastic in hunting him down to have him locked away.

I care; it gets tiring explaining to people what hackers are about. Even if we don't have the power to change that perception, I still think it is important that we maintain the positive perception of our group in Phoenix.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **nak** on Thu January 17th, 2008 10:13:07 PM

I was trying to make the point that if shop-dropping was done by an anonymous individual (for example porn DVDs in children's movies) it wouldn't be related to hacking activity (not saying that I think its a good idea), on the other hand hacking a elementary school site and posting porn would defiantly damage the hacker image.

My post was also a cry for more creativity, porn DVDs replacing children's movies could be a laugh, but a off the top of the head kind of prank.  And I already said I wouldn't think putting a linux distribution would be totally rad, it would be aight, and maybe a couple people would benefit, but I just don't see it as subversive and cool as something on par with banksy.

Apple stores would be fun (and difficult, very merchandised) to shopdrop, maybe some fake boxes of &quot;Apple Windows&quot; or &quot;Microsoft OS X&quot; with some ubuntu CD and whatever literature that proves apple to be evil <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->  (just off the top of my head  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) --> )

Well, it's not like a contest ... more I'm interested in seeing what problems people run into and seeing if people get organized than what the specific output of the group is. Like think of even seeing a PHX2600 distro (and if not a security distro, than maybe just pre-burned ubuntu .isos or something) in the back darkened corner of a Fry's Electronics, and knowing that it was logic and medicine storm and whoever, that's pretty elite; you can work your way up to bigger and bolder hacks. Agree on the pr0n being a bad idea, though. :-/. Like it'd kinda' be funny but then only if you could get people's reactions in real-time; I guess if you had a hidden camera at the customer service / returns desk it would be youtube material - otherwise you have to rely on the message you're putting out to be satisfying to say without being able to hear back from  anyone, which is tricky.

On that note - maybe instead of going with Linux distros we could drop some anti-walmart DVDs in some prominent location? We'd need access to a printer, a bunch of blank DVD-Rs and a copy of some documentary - probably tons of fodder on google video and bittorrent. ^_-.

[quote:vnsht1xv]&lt;Shadow&gt; can those PDA scanners that they use be used to change prices?
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; yes, if youre a department manager
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; logged in as one
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; or someone with rights as one
&lt;Shadow&gt; what can you tell me about auth?
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; username scheme: first initial, second initial, first 5 letters of last name, ie. jqsmith = john q smith
&lt;Shadow&gt; password policy?
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; password? XXXstorenumber ie. jqs2600
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; unless changed
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; also: wal-mart
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; the xxx0000 is a new scheme, i'm told
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; wal-mart is standard password for most fucktards
&lt;Shadow&gt; so, if i find a store manager and look at his badge, or look it up on the wall at the customer service desk.... I have 1000 permutations to try?
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; Yeah.
&lt;Shadow&gt; ... any idea if the wifi key is as simple?
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; not sure, but it probably is. at this moment i can't remember. but if i recall right. they may use some sort of script to set up wifi.
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; ie. there may be a standard password, simular for all stores
&lt;Shadow&gt; sweet.
&lt;Shadow&gt; <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; i'm sure if you had a laptop outside the store, and sat there for an hour.
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; you might find the key
&lt;Shadow&gt; it's WEP around here
&lt;Shadow&gt; i'm sure i can do it faster.
&lt;Shadow&gt; aircrack-ng.
&lt;Shadow&gt; but, even after that
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; its wpa here
&lt;Shadow&gt; there's the reverse engineering of the protocol for database access
&lt;Shadow&gt; wpa1 or 2?
&lt;Shadow&gt; wpa1 is just as easy to crack
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; theres 2 different telzons/geminis/scanners, or whatever you wan't to call it.
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; not sure.
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; 2 maybe.
&lt;Shadow&gt; blah, faster to run through the registry while using one that a stocker sets down for a minute at 3am.
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; fyi, 2 or 3 am is a good time to walk around walmart
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; 1hr breaks
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; and also, associates like to put telzons in microwaves, or in their baskets
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; and also, in furnature cabnets
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; :p
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; if you don't already know
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; pretty much look in the displays if not out in public
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; but in all honesty, if you look during 1st and 2nd
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; you may find it out in public, on desks, logged in
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; with full rights
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; once i found a fucktard that had price change rights logged on, just before 3rd shift
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; on the sporting goods counter
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; sometimes they appear logged on, but when you try to do something, boink, nada, logged off.
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; they log off auto after uh, not sure how long. its within 2hrs though. of idle.
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; and also when the associate logs out
&lt;Shadow&gt; you mean punches out?
&lt;Shadow&gt; what if i login while the guys not on duty?
&lt;Shadow&gt; is it tied into the whole walmart system?
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; you can't log on when an associate is off the clock
&lt;Shadow&gt; so it's tied in in some fashion in real-time with the employee database as well.... being how insecure these little things are, any chances i can mess with payroll?
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; not sure about messing with payroll through a telzon
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; but in the back, through the doors to the breakroom, you'll find computers they use, tied in remotely somehow
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; lets you do various tasks
&lt;Shadow&gt; aww. it'd be nifty to give the new guy a $50/hr job and the boss a minimum wage
&lt;Shadow&gt; any idea if it's got SSL over w/e they're using?
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; i believe its all just stupid means of telnet'ing in
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; to raise someones pay is more than just changing it in the computer.
&lt;Shadow&gt; what about docking it?
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; doesn't get finalized untill physical paperwork occurs
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; pay decreases only occur when a position changes to a lesser one, but some say that your pay cannot go down. its iffy.
&lt;Shadow&gt; OH
&lt;Shadow&gt; one more question
&lt;Shadow&gt; one really big important one
&lt;Shadow&gt; is there a way to make the changes globally announced so it propigates to other stores, or no?
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; price changes are only affecting that specific store, not others.
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; my knowledge is limited, but maybe with an account that is &quot;above&quot; the stores
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; you might be able to affect all.
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; but i don't think it would be done via a telzon
&lt;Shadow&gt; regional manager acct vs store?
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; something of that sort, can't say for certain
&lt;Shadow&gt; well, it doesn't matter if it can't be done *with the telzon*, so long as i can do it through the same communications channel w/ a laptop
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; mhm
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; well, i'm out
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; alter
&lt;friend_that_works_for_walmart&gt; later
&lt;Shadow&gt; later man, thanks for the info
