## Phone Trips
Posted by **binfordman** on Sat February 7th, 2009 02:46:18 AM

It looks like one of my favourite sites phone trips.com hasn't been updated in a while. I heard Evan is going though some problems and the site hasn't been his top priority. 

No recent updates though. Just what I got from emailing them not too long ago.

Actually there quite a few updates. Just check the last modified dates at...

Or the red ***NEW*** and ***REMASTERED &amp; REVISED*** labels on the front page. <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

Edit: You can also get Phone Trips updates at the BinRev forums, as in this thread...
