Though I'd pass this along:

The Arizona Business and Liberty Experience ( ABLE Conf ) is a grass-roots conference for Linux and Open Source right here in Arizona.  It is organized by volunteers representing a broad coalition of Arizona Free Software groups promoting the latest developments and information on Open Source.

WHAT: First and foremost the ABLEconf is a conference designed to present compelling topics of interest to users of Linux, BSD, Firefox, OpenOffice, Ruby on Rails, the Gimp, and other projects. The conference will also feature panel discussions on the use of Open Source software in the enterprise as well as licensing issues and legal concerns. These topics span a range of interests from technical to motivational, educational to organizational, as well as various related community interests. Attendees will find out what is happening in the Open Source world from some of the people directly involved.

ABLEconf is also a social event. Following the conference, attendees will have a chance to meet, mingle, and network with like-minded enthusiasts and professionals in the field. It will be a great event to catch up with old friends, make new ones, meet project contributors in person, discuss new ideas and develop new business relationships. Best of all, attendance is FREE.

WHEN: ABLEconf will be held on Saturday September 20th, 2008 from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm Arizona time.

WHERE: ABLEconf will be held at the University of Advancing Technology (UAT) at 2625 W Baseline Rd Tempe, AZ 85283, right off the 1-10 and Baseline, down the street from Fry's Electronics. Free parking is available in UAT's parking lot.
