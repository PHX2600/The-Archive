## New laptop, Fireside Chat Presentations
Posted by **jargon** on Fri May 21st, 2010 01:10:43 PM

I got a new laptop, whoohoo. Boy, am I ever in debt now!

  * Max combined processor speed: 18.4GHz.
  * RAM: 4GB
  * OS: 64bit Win7 Pro
  * Brand: ASUS

Anyhoo, now to the meat of this post.

I have been returned to troll rank for some reason, possibly due to failing at
the popularity contest that shouldn't even exist.

I don't post docs on code in the code section because I wait for someone to
reply first. I usually post code as a reverse engineering challenge, I just
never post that it is one, because most of my friends that I posted the code for
already know it is such.

I don't really appreciate moderators and site administrators for stripping my
permissions simply due to not being someone I care to interact with. They just
don't get me, due to being uncertain in their choices.

I usually know what I am doing, where others don't know what I am doing; I don't
feel the need to constantly explain myself, because the people I usually post
code on here for, already know who they are and what to expect, and will ask me
at the meet if they are interested in a fireside presentation regarding such.

Anyhoo, I don't mean to say that you can't read code, what I really mean is that
you (you know who "you" are), isn't really gifted at reverse engineering the
execution, methodology, and implementation of such source code.

Like how people post encryption exercises, (which are usually bunk to begin
with), I post reverse engineering exercises using genuine "hot" code.

I hope this clears everything up, if it doesn't, then apparently we will never
see eye to eye in regards to simple forum interaction, and your best interest as
you specifically who ever you may be is to simply inquire about such in-person
at the meet with me, in-order to clear this up.

Ciao, Keal
