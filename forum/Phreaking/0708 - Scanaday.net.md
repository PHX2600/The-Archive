Scanaday.net is a project conceived by samo over on the BinRev forums. It's literally a scan per day and it's already turned up great numbers, like...

847-931-9951

Participate if you can!  It doesn't take long to scan one hundred numbers and <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.handscan.net/">http://www.handscan.net/</a><!-- m --> can help.

The website is

Sounds interesting, I'll take a look at it and see about contributing.

Edit: I dialed that 847 number you listed, what is it?  All I hear is pulsing.  Is it some sort of digital transmission?

Guess is a broken reorder. Email scans to handscanaday at gmail dot com.
