So I made my PSP into a GPS. it was pretty easy. I bought a PSP-GPS-290 unit' You can get one here:

I used these instructions for my PSP 2001 Darth Vader Edition:

Here's a download:

It works pretty well. tells me my speed, altitude, directions, I compiled my maps from google maps. you can run a shell script or google and find the gmdl app for compiling the maps. This took me a minute to figure, but its easy now.

here it is:
