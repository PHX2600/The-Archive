It's the first week of April meaning meeting this Friday.  We'll be meeting at Pink Spot as usual and I may be assisting Penguin in learning [http://git-scm.com](Git).  Also, we will be discussion the possibility of moving our meeting location to Cartel Coffee in Tempe starting next month.

Please do meet in Tempe. Tonight I arrived quite late and did not see hackers, chixors or cypherpunks that I could recognize but did see a few mimes... <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D --> 
Since they were not spaeking....asking if they were 2600 seemed a moot...point.
