## GUI for GDB
Posted by **fightgar** on Thu May 12th, 2011 01:39:19 PM

Howdy folks, anyone use a gui for the gnu debugger?
I've searched around DDD looks crazy...
insight looks simpler,
I used to use OllyDBG in windows, and am pretty comfy with that style debugger.  Anything like that or does anyone have a recommendation (or something completely different from GDB?)
