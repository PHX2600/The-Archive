There is so much potential with this!  I just stumbled across this when looking
up other things, I guess some guys have used this to
[crack A5 encryption on GSM networks](http://www.hackaday.com/2007/08/11/cccamp-2007-gsm-a5-cracking).
I bet we could actually get hacking those peter piper pizza vibrators with this
piece of equipment!

I think it's time for me to sell some stuff and start saving :? maybe... give me
more ideas on what can be hacked with this!

What about auto locking shopping carts?  I have one, haven't taken it apart
yet...

It should be possible with the
[LFTX](http://www.ettus.com/downloads/miscdboards_v3b.pdf)
daughterboard, but I've seen some cheaper ways of (un)locking shopping carts:
