I just contacted my hosting company and they chucked a can of email response at me.
So I called them, it was hard communicating, but I recommended myself writing a more detailed help ticket next time... I really doubt they have any other customers using python CGI other than me trying it now.

Does anyone else have hosting with python support and be willing to try that script?
If so, I can show what SHOULD be executed vs. the plaintext being displayed.  I really think there's some config issues on their end.

Thanks.
