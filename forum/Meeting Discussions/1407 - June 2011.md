Lola on Central south of Camelback.

Topics?

Attendees?

I probably will not be at this meeting.  Will be attending [http://www.desertbash.com/](Desertbash) all weekend (competing in a tournament).  However, I do believe AltF4 was planning on working on the Defcon CTF qualifications at the meeting.

Indeed! DefCon CTF Qualifiers will have started by meeting time, so we'll be working on it at the meet. 

Following the meeting, anyone's welcome over at my house for additional haxxors. I'll tell you my exact location at the meeting or via PM, but it's essentially 20 minutes east of Lola's Cafe. I'll buy pizza and drinks (or whatever else we want).

I'll be there for the CTF quals.

I might try and grab NaK if he isn't tripping balls.

Haha, dude, you don't trip balls during a hacking contest, you smoke meth.  Learn how to use drugs, don't let the drugs use you  <!-- s:!: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /><!-- s:!: -->  lol
