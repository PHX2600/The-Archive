[color=#40FF40:21kyziqh] So i'm trying to make it through this movie right now called Meet the Feebels, so far pretty bad. It's by Peter Jackson the guy who did the Dead Alive movie. It's an entirely puppet cast but the do all kinds of fucked up stuff. There is a lot of puppet sex and one of them is a herion addict. Some are dealers. Sound like it would be funny or interesting atleast huh? No it's making my brain hurt. The saddest thing is I'll probably finish it just in case it has that one spectacular scene in it.[/color:21kyziqh]

Hehe, Meet The Feebles is incredibly stupid, but still worth watching.

You just gotta expect that it's stupid, like Lobster Man From Mars, or Beer Drinkers In Outer Space.

I bet they're all on NetFlix's online dealie.

Off topic, but teh_fed -- could you switch your font colour to something less brain-melting? ^_^;; 

It might just be my schema, but I see:

ya i am going to have to sit and watch it all the way through i just got to the golf scene and at first i was just thinking why the fuck are these two horribly costumed characters playing golf. then when it was a drug deal it just got super rediculous. i know i'll be in the mood for it one of these days.
