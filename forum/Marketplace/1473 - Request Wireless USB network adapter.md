## /Request/ Wireless USB network adapter
Posted by **Medicine Storm** on Fri October 14th, 2011 09:15:03 AM

Looking for a wireless network adapter (preferably USB) that supports packet
capture. Doesn't have to be used if you guys know where to get one new.

To be used with Backtrack, so proper drivers are a must.

I recently picked up the Alfa AWUS036H off of ebay for like $25. It uses the
RTL8187L chipset and is 1 Watt! It fully supports injection out of the box.

In general, head over to:

and scroll down to the USB section near the bottom of the page. This page would
be a good place to start with your research.

I've got 2x DWA-110 off ebay, I couldn't figure out how to attach an external
antenna so they're both up for grabs (works with aircrack-ng suite)

I got them for 12 bucks each, so yeah, one is sealed in box, the other has been
opened, poked, prodded:

But I bought some $10 D-Link AP/Client/Repeater off craigslist that I had to
repair (dang craigslisters...) which is working for... my purposes...

So, I'm willing to let go of these adapters for the same amount I bought them
for, seem pretty good, and if you have 2 you can do some badass "attacks" think

... that was funny :)
