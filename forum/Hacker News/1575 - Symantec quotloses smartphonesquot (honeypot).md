## Symantec "loses smartphones" (honeypot)

This is hilarious. Symantec drops a bunch of custom root-kitted phones around
big cities to see what people do with them. Will strangers look through the
contacts? photos? password text file? banking info? etc...

...Yes, very much so (majority of them do).

Hah! But seriously, 50% of humanity having redeeming qualities is not too bad
IOHO. Was expecting worse. Good job, humans; you're not half bad!

My friend recently found a lost cell phone and I cautioned him about this story
so instead of keeping it or selling it he turned it into the cops lol. So I
guess some good came out of it.
