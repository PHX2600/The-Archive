## Ting (A new MVNO)
Posted by **PHLAK** on Mon March 19th, 2012 02:57:52 PM

I recently learned about [url=http&#58;//www&#46;ting&#46;com:12ab2ski]Ting[/url:12ab2ski], a new no bull shit [url=http&#58;//en&#46;wikipedia&#46;org/wiki/Mobile_virtual_network_operator:12ab2ski]mobile virtual network operator[/url:12ab2ski] (MVNO) that piggybacks on the Sprint network.  By &quot;no bull shit&quot; I mean they try their best to make everything they do clear and honest.  What originally caught my interest about Ting was the fact they would reimburse you if your voice/text/data usage for the month fell into a lower tier than your plan.  Also, Ting was created by Tucows so I feel confident they have a well based grasp on the technology and customers. After looking into it more and doing a few calculations I realized I could be saving money after ~6 months by switching to Ting from Versizon, so I decided to ditch my contract plan and buy some phones for the wife and I.  I've since recevied and activated my phones and after about a week things have been good minus one small glitch I'll explain later.

A quick overview of Ting's pros and cons:

Now, the &quot;glitch&quot; I mentioned earlier has to do with text messaging.  Since the wife and I use Google Voice numbers for text messaging we decided to go with the zero text messages plan on Ting.  To prevent getting charged for any text message usage the first thing I did after activating the phones was to disable incoming and ougoing text messages from my Ting control pannel on both of my phones.  Well, somehow my wife was able to send two text messages from her non-Google Voice number, thus bumping our text message usage up to the lowest plan which would cause me to be billed an extra $3.

I've got a support ticket in and I'm working with a representative to figure this out.  They've even stated this should not have happened, as those settings are in place to prevent the sending and receiving of text messages all together.  Ting has only been public since early February so bugs can (and likely will) happen.  However, it seems like the support staff is more then happy and willing to help correct these issues.

--

* At the begining of the month you're billed based on the minutes/texts/data plans you chose.  At the end of the month if your voice/text/data usage for the month fell into a lower tier than your chosen plan you will be reimbursed the difference.  Alternatively, if you go over your plan you will be charged the difference but wont incur any overage fees.

** This might be a pro for some and a con for others, so I included it in both lists.

Thanks for the writeup. I'm sick of the death star and sick of waiting for republic wireless, so Ting sounds perfect. Here's a $50 off first phone code for Ting.

I just received my first *regular* Ting bill (no device/activation fees), check it out:

My regular Verizon bill was ~$135/mo, needless to say, I'm happy.
