## Independents can't vote in Feb. 5 primary election
Posted by **PHLAK** on Wed December 26th, 2007 02:43:54 PM

For those of you Ron Paul (or Obama) supporters out there, be sure to change
your registered political preference by Jan. 7th.

A quote from the article:

> Independent voters are a growing political force in Arizona, but their
> influence falls short of being able to cast a ballot in the presidential
> primary.
>
> A record 28 percent of the state's registered voters are independents, meaning
> they belong to no party recognized by the state.
>
> **By law, no independents can vote on Feb. 5 in the state's Presidential
> **Preference Election**, which determines the number of delegates each
> **candidate receives in the nomination races.

I feel like I am going to have to cut myself for registering a REP, eh, hell is
freezing over.

I totally agree, it's just plain retarded.

It's going to be pretty interesting, I think. R.P. sure does have a lot of
supporters, but do they vote?

Of course the polls don't show R.P. very high, because R.P. supporters don't
take those polls. And of course online polls show him QUITE high, but do average
voters ever see _those_ polls? There's definitely no real
gage or even remotely accurate prediction as to the possible popular turnout
right now...

But will all those R.P. supporters -actually- go out and vote? Really, if they
-all- did, then he's got a good shot. What's the chance of that?

Anyway, I'm a bit of a pessimist/paranoid freak, and only vote with my dollar.

Um... yeah... I think of anyone, it's the Ron Paul supporters that know the most
important contribution they can make to his campaign, more so than all the
propaganda, more than all the donations, even more than all the videos or
testimonies, the most important thing is their vote.

In fact, I'd be willing to bet more people will NOT vote for the front runner
because the media says they've practically won anyway, so why would the average
voter waste their time and effort to go out to vote for their candidate who is
"guaranteed to win" according to the main stream media.

Let's hope that's the case :). It's just that in the past, the younger vote has
always been hard to get (support is always easy).

We can't believe this crap is constitutional! ...So, will we be allowed to vote
if we register as a member of the communist party or something, or do we have to
register as a democrazy or republoonatic only?

There was a guy who was working real hard to get a law passed that would allow
independents and PNDs to vote in primaries, but I guess that didn't make it.

SO, yes. Democrat or Republican.  It is a 2 party system  :evil:
