## Fourth Awakening People's Army

Kinda let a cat out of the bag, and now several million or more people may attempt to attend the March 5th 2009 Phoenix 2600 meet-up and every meet-up there-after. (I ask of you to please not be dick admins like you have in the past by censoring this sort of stuff.)

[b:2sq2lxn5]2010 03/01 Fourth Awakening People's Army[/b:2sq2lxn5]

I am the originating founder of the Fourth Awakening People's Army. Here at the Fourth Awakening People's Army, we train our constituents in the arts of self-healing and regeneration, pre- and retro-cognition, parallel phasing and shifting, re-manifestation and alter-manifestation, self-preservation amid quantum dissonance annihilation, and various other dark arts for use in the field. Our league is not limited to any given local, era, or universe; we are of many faiths and many backgrounds. If you wish to know more, just hit up any of the various hacking or psionics &quot;chat rooms&quot; on the IRC (Internet Relay Protocol), and ask around. I can't really give out any of the locations of any actual constituents, due to the nature of such individuals not exactly needing to act from the same point in history they act upon and/or monitor. You really can't expect the information collected after-the-fact of it becoming declassified or otherwise public information to not have simply be transmitted back prior via quantum tunnel conduit dark fiber back to an earlier era. This QTC was invented or at-least rediscovered in a laboratory while sandwiching layers of optical material and then using a laser in-order to transmit the data components of the mp3 &quot;Hey Jude&quot; by the band &quot;The Beatles&quot; to the destination sensor, however it was soon discovered by a technician shortly after to their embarrassment that the data had been received by the destination sensor three seconds before it had even been sent by the transmitter. As you can clearly see, daisy chaining such material in this manner allows base stations which cache such traffic along various positions in the QTC dark fiber routes, allows exchange of real-time streams from any point along the route's span in space/time to any other point, independent of temporal space. You can't really expect anything to be secure anymore due to the nature of the simple ability to hijack these conduits, especially under the training of those in the People's Army of the Fourth Awakening, especially under the hyper-distributed nature of such a league. You've probably seen the two movies &quot;White Noise&quot; and &quot;Minority Report&quot;, you can see where such lines in the legal code and such means of law enforcement practices cannot as-is easily be used in confidence in-order to seek out and prosecute such individuals. Peace out! --alias jargon, originating founder of the Fourth Awakening People's Army.

If you really need more information, read Serial E-Zine. (established 1994) You can also hit up &quot;Phoenix 2600&quot; ( [url:2sq2lxn5]http&#58;//phx2600&#46;org/[/url:2sq2lxn5] ) or &quot;HeatSyncLabs&quot; ( [url:2sq2lxn5]http&#58;//HeatSyncLabs&#46;org/[/url:2sq2lxn5] ) to meet-up in person. If you can't make it any other 2600 meet-up or hacker space around the world, you talk to others at various conferences such as &quot;BlackHat&quot;, &quot;DEFCON&quot;, &quot;H.O.P.E&quot;, &quot;ToorCamp&quot;, &quot;Phreaknik&quot;, &quot;FEDCON&quot;, &quot;CCC&quot;. You can call up any hacker/phreaker phone conference such as &quot;Phone Losers America&quot;, &quot;SoCal&quot;, &quot;Telephreak&quot;, etc. You can even tune into such radio shows as &quot;BinRev Radio&quot;, &quot;Off the Hook&quot;, &quot;Off The Wall&quot;, etc. You could even subscribe to various magazines such as &quot;Make Magazine&quot;, &quot;2600: The Hacker's Quarterly&quot;, &quot;Blacklisted 411!&quot;, &quot;Science NEWS&quot;, &quot;Discover&quot;, &quot;AIR-FORCE&quot;, &quot;Nova&quot;, &quot;Scientific America&quot;, &quot;Psychology Today&quot;, &quot;3-2-1 Contact&quot;, etc. Good luck! -alias jargon

Hopefully, the database and server doesn't fry when people start joining the forums, and that the entire megaopolis doesn't end up in a SHTF scenario where the military has to be called in handling the millions upon millions flooding the city from all over the world attempting to attend the meet-up and all future meet-ups.

I replayed the Feb 7th 2010 [b:37aypzh4]&quot;The Keal Show: Supervillain Sunday: S'Aint Just Any Bowl, This Is The Super Bowl: Side A&quot;[/b:37aypzh4] over VoIP on the Oct 22nd 2009 [url:37aypzh4]http&#58;//telephreak&#46;org/[/url:37aypzh4] Asterisk PBX via hijacking the National Security Agency quantum tunnel conduit last night, Feb 27th 2010.

1. The first attempt to place the call on Feb 27th 2010, the destination was invalid.
2. The second attempt to place the call on Feb 27th 2010, a National Security Agency error code &quot;S&quot; failure played.
3. The third attempt to place the call on Feb 27th 1010, successful and picked up in Oct 22nd 2009. (20100227011257490)

Or perhaps, thank goodness I sniped the mass-media marketability of that joyous &quot;hacking&quot; group.

COINTELPRO, BITCHES.

..or whatever the Hell that FBI thing was.

Antimeme would be proud of me if they weren't such tools.
