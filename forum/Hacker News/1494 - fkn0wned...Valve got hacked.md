## fkn0wned...Valve got hacked
Posted by **XlogicX** on Fri November 11th, 2011 10:07:26 PM

It started with their forums getting defaced by the fkn0wned group. Valve also
states that their encrypted passwords, credit cards, etc... were accessed,
though there was no evidence that this info was stolen (I'm sceptical).

So...that kind of sucks

The difference between this break in and others is that Valve took the proper
precautionary methods to protect your data.  They salted and hashed passwords
and encrypted all credit card information.  Also, they stated that they don't
believe any of that data was taken even though it was accessible to the thieves.
Lastly, if you had Steam Guard enabled, you're even more protected.
