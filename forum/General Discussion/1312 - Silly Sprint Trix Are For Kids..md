Hi all so spunk-tastic sprint holds a competition to harvest free commercial work in the disguise of a 30 second contest and I couldn't pass up an opportunity to rib em so I actually make a decent 30 seconds with a fun ending and sneak in a 2600 tone into the clip; and not a sinlge one of their screening group caught the 2600 joke (or they didn't care) because the video made it to their competition. 

Don't worry about the voting and all that crap I just thought you guys might enjoy the clip.
