## Email Spam - legal reverse
Posted by **rzonz** on Fri August 7th, 2009 11:46:43 PM

I'm a teacher and we've got this online email listserv that doesn't seem to be managed very well.

Is there a legal way to reverse spam this guy?

I did one look up and it came back empty: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:doyoulikepie@live.co.uk">doyoulikepie@live.co.uk</a><!-- e -->

Another &quot;free&quot; look up found it in Redmond, but how can that be if it's a UK email.

No clue...

Turn the other cheek my brother. Or, if you really hate him, gather a botnet of php webhosts that allow fopen URL and systematically send out a mail() bomb.
