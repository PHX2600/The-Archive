## Big Magnet
Posted by **ThatGuy** on Wed November 26th, 2008 02:21:42 PM

I was curious if anyone knows if it would be cheaper to make an electro magnet
versus buying a rare earth magnet with 1600lbs of pull force? The rare earth
magnet goes for about $250 with a shielded case.

Probably cheaper initially but once you consider the amount of power it will
draw it may not stay cheaper for very long,

bonus of electromagnet is you can turn it on and off.

I agree with Penguin, the power consumption may run up the price in the long
run, but if you need to be able to turn it off, electromagnet is the way to go.

just steal a bunch of harely davidson aletnator rotors they are made of rare
earth magnets

lol

as for cost depends on how much use and how often you will use it you can slap
togther a elctro magnet on the cheap but like was stated before the power
consumption but i dont think if you are going to use it sparse like it the power
usage will out do the cost of a rare earth in less over a long amount of time

This is the size of the magnet

On one website it says 1600lbs pull force and on the other it says 587lbs for
the same size magnet. Something in that range should do. The surface area needs
to be fairly large and a disk shape would be best.

Ok I'll bite, what's this going to be used for :mrgreen:

Its a special lockpick  ;)

For retail product locks amirite?

If so definitely go rare earth electro-mag would be too clunky.

No, its not for commercial Adams-Rite setups, I have a whole set of tools for
those. It's mainly for residential, but can be used on a bunch of other stuff to
attack the solenoid in certain locks.

There use to be this science demonstration tool thing that had 2 ends to it and
2 people would try and pull it apart sort of like tug-a-war. It was about the
same size and shape I need, and the magnet used was tiny, smaller than a watch
battery. If something like that could be made but with a bigger magnet, and more
power, that is rechargeable. I think it would be perfect.

Talking about it more has got me thinking and reminded me of that science toy. I
wish I could remember what it was called. All I remember was that 2 people could
not pull it apart when the power was on. It didn't drain fast at all. I remember
messing with it all of the time before class.

Sounds pretty intense for such a tiny surface.

Hopefully you can figure it out and treat us all to some magnet magics.

which reminds me of this movie about the magnetic field I saw which made me want
to build an ultra low frequency radio...

if you haven't seen it here's the link

but I bet a few of you have.
