## Bizarre tail/break light electrical failure.
Posted by **jargon** on Tue November 3rd, 2009 09:32:08 AM

The rear right tail light in my car doesn't light up when I turn on all the headlamps and runner lights.

The turn signal, reverse signal, four-way signal, and break signal work fine.

The weird thing: The break signal and tail light are the same bulb.

This is where it gets really weird, when I replaced the bulb, the original bulb had congealed gelatin all over the inside of the socket and base of the bulb. Cleaning out the socket and replacing the tail/brake bulb continued with the same behavior when testing the signal lights again.

I was alerted to this screwy tail light by another driver while on the way to the HeatSync Labs hackerspace on the 28th last month. I am keeping an Auto Zone cash receipt for the bulb in my car, in case an officer stops me regarding it, so that I have proof that I actually am already in the process of taking the steps to correct the issue.

I was thinking of testing all the fuses using an LED and a low power battery. If a fuse is blown, the LED won't light up when the circuit is connected. If none of the fuses are bad, then I am thinking it is either corroded wiring or a faulty electrical systems micro-controller. I will have to stop by my parents' house to pick up all my components, that way I don't have to drive further than that in order to purchase the light emitting diodes etc.

Any worthwhile helpful suggestions?

Also, one of the 2.5 gallon disposable water dispensers I had in my trunk for attendees at the hackerspace busted open in my trunk, and now the floor panel in my trunk is all melted to the shape of the spare tire below it. I only note this because I am thinking it might be part of the reason for the electrical failure and because I am wondering what I can do to correct the damage done.
