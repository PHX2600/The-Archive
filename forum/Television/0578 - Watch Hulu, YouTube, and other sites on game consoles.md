Someone showed me this software that is (at time of this writing) currently in
public beta.

[PlayOn](http://themediamall.com/) will let you watch/stream videos/movies/tv
shows from sites like Hulu, YouTube, and many more on your Xbox360, PS3, and
other UPNP consoles/devices. Looks like they are promising support for the Wii
soon as well.
