## Wow Ethiopia sucks!

Sorry for spamming a bunch of news recently, but this is also really interesting. Ethiopia is banning Skype, Google Talk, and VOIP in general, it holds a 15 year prison sentence. TOR is also against the rules, and they are attempting deep packet inspection to block it (not sure if that is 100% effective though).

&quot;they imposed these bans because of 'national security concerns' and to protect the state’s telecommunications monopoly. The country only has one ISP, the state-owned Ethio Telecom, and has been filtering its citizen’s Internet access for quite some time now to suppress opposition blogs and other news outlets.&quot;

Doing it wrong.  <!-- s:cry: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very Sad" /><!-- s:cry: -->
