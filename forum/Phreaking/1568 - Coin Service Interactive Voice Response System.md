## Coin Service Interactive Voice Response System
Posted by **dual** on Sat March 3rd, 2012 07:16:14 AM

While waiting at the newish West Dublin BART stop, I decided to kill some time
playing with a Pacific Telemanagement Services (PTS) COCOT. I started hitting
star codes and *81 returned, "Please deposit five cents." Had to be something.
Put in five cents and it rang.

It picked up and Allison Smith announced, "PTS Coin Service Interactive Voice
Response System. Please enter your user ID." I entered 12345 and was greeted
with the following menu.

    1 - Close tickets
    2 - Look up codes
    - 1 Problem codes
    - 2
    4 - Touch tone test
    5 - Handset test

I did the touch tone test and listened to the problem codes, which went on and
on. Didn't want to mess with tickets. I wonder if a more privileged user ID
would get an option 3. Next time I'll get a recording.
