## Trading for Commodore
Posted by **RetroTech1541** on Mon September 13th, 2010 01:48:10 AM

Willing to trade off 1 1541 disk drive with optional power chord and fat-din serial cable for pretty much any 8-bit Commodore gear, hoping for a breadbox c64 or vic20, would consider other stuff.

I've got an old broken commodore I yoink'd the SID out of it if you want it for parts (keeping my working unit  <!-- s:geek: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_geek.gif" alt=":geek:" title="Geek" /><!-- s:geek: --> ), also ran across a big bag of 256k DRAM in 16 pin DIPs part# TMM41256P-12 at my friend's old parent's house, grabbed one to get info on it and I really don't know what to do with it/them (yet) maybe you would have a use retro? Or anyone else near the &quot;bottom of the food chain&quot;?  I'm not even sure I'm allowed to offer them up, but will find out iAi...

I gave away so much C64 stuff/books/games when I was up in flag to this dude from Cottonwood, he was all smitten... super cute  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D --> sorry retro <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->
Also have a box of unused punch cards if anyone wants some memorabilia from the digital papyrus age.
Do not want disk drive though, gave a couple of those away myself... rather have something like this if I were gonna do anything now: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nkcelectronics.com/commodore-xexm1541-ada1541.html">http://www.nkcelectronics.com/commodore ... a1541.html</a><!-- m -->
