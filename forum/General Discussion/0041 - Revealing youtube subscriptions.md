## Revealing youtube subscriptions
Posted by **Valveritas** on Fri February 1st, 2008 09:10:09 PM

While trying to figure out to hide my youtube subscriptions today, I came across the opposite, and that's how to reveal them if they're hidden.   <!-- s:roll: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><!-- s:roll: --> 

So just type:

[b:r5v5biod]
<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/profile_subscriptions?user=name">http://www.youtube.com/profile_subscriptions?user=name</a><!-- m -->
[/b:r5v5biod]

For 'name' you would enter the profile name. Even though you can keep your listed subscriptions out of the layout, it's still there.  

An even lazier way to do is (if you don't have this text in front of you is to click on [b:r5v5biod]Videos |  Favorites  |  Playlists  |  Groups  |  Friends  |  Subscriber[/b:r5v5biod] and change whatever is after the '_' to 'subscriptions'.

Nice job! I remember when you could do a similar thing with photobucket with people's private photo albums  <!-- s:o --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /><!-- s:o -->
