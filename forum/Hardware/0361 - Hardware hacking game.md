Found this one on hackaday and played thru it, simple but educational, the last
level is a tough one!

you're a secret hardware hax0r agent in the future working for some kind of
agency and you are reversing  electronic locking systems etc... I wont ruin it
but its 4 levels of fun and worth a download.

this was a fun game trying to figure out if there is more than one way to solve
some of the puzzles
