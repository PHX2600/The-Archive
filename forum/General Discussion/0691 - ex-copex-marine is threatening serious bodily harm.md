## ex-cop/ex-marine is threatening serious bodily harm
Posted by **Valveritas** on Mon December 8th, 2008 11:43:25 AM

Some ex-cop/ex-marine is threatening to do serious bodily harm to me online.  I'm just quoting the pertinent parts:

I would have likely sought you out and quite literally put my boot up your ass, and then hospitalized your sorry ass just for good measure. If you doubt my ability to have actually pulled this off, then you have just made a critical tactical error in the form of underestimating an extremely dangerous opponent.

is liable to have a nasty "accident", courtesy of his peers. 
...
I also have resources you are not aware of. Some very substantial ones, in fact. And I assure you, were I to do something such as that, there would not be any repercussions for me. Though I strongly believe in "Rule of Law", for whatever it's worth this day and age (not much), and I've never condoned vigilanteism, there are certain things that simply must be dealt with, outside of "legitimate" channels if necessary. And lemme tell ya, you don't nearly as much about me as you think you do. I happen to very skilled at deception, misinformation, and hiding in plain sight. Had to be, in order to carry out our team's assignments, supposedly for the "just, honorable, and righteous good guys" of this once great nation, but that's whole different story, from a whole different life, and one I won't get into to. 
[/quote:nho1kpo5]

Here's the other funny part.  If he's a master of deception why do I already have 4 pictures of him?  Why do I know his age, that he lives in Tucson AZ, and the he has a dating profile on Match.com?? lol   (Of course he doesn't know that I know this).

I figured this would be a good opportunity to talk about how to protect yourself from psychos on the internet, by finding out as much about the person as possible in case _they do_ make good on their threats.   Most of the tools I use to locate or track someone's presence on the internet are standard searches and a bit of intuition.  Of course, if you have a phone number or name you have more options available.  I'm curious what tools you use on very limited information.

If you have a name you might be able to get your docs on the guy, and where are these shady parts of the internet you're hanging out at? hehe

Don't have a name.  I suppose if I spent a little time I could probably social engineer it through his match.com profile.  Yep.  <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> 

Ok, maybe I need more of a challenge.  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

I hang out at some pretty tough places on the internet nak... such as some abandonware sites... you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villany.  <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

Are you sure he's an ex cop/marine and not just a [url=http://lonelymachines.org/mall-ninjas/:11p6m8la]mall> [url=http://lonelymachines.org/2006/08/12/return-of-the-iron-fist-of-the-mall-ninja/:11p6m8la]ninja>?

I doubt he has ever been in any military branch. He sounds like all wannabe military posers sound. He definitely sounds like a mall ninja. Its against the law to threaten someone so you can always get a restraining order if you find out who he is. That should shut him up, or his parents will ground him. You could use social engineering on his match profile, play a hot female get some good pictures, drag out a phone number, address, name, age, etc. He should give them up with no problem in anticipation of losing his virginity, with a girl. Go the simple route, use what you know to connect the dots and see if it is really him. Have some fun with it get some really embarrassing pictures, copied e-mails, and expose all of his aliases in a public area. Don't let him know what you know, then let us know how it goes and make an example of him.

ThatGuy:

That was essentially the gist of my plan...  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

He may very well be a Mall Ninja, but not really the "lawful hero type" mentioned by Ugly.  He constantly brings up references to firearms. In fact, in  a recent thread someone quipped about him putting two bullets in my chest and one in my head, and he replied:

[quote:1eih7zyj]"Nah, that's overkill. Waste of good ammo. One in the the head should be quite sufficient to do the job. 'Specially bein's how I prefer heavier calibers like .40 S&amp;W or .45 ACP. If you don't miss, then lighter recoil/muzzle flip, and faster fllowup shots are irrelevant. With the lighter calibers you'll also need that followup shot, hence the lighter recoil becomes important. I don't have that problem."[/quote:1eih7zyj]

As far as embarassing pictures, here's a good start: [removed by request]

Talked to an ex-marine friend the other day.  His take on it was:

[quote:kpq274se]
I've met a few actual "supercommando" types, and let me assure you if they were going to harm someone they would not send an e-mail announcing their arrival.

Personally, I would take this right to the cops, because even if he
isn't "supercommando", even an untrained lunatic is capable of doing something stupid and dangerous that could harm you or your property. [/quote:kpq274se]

Hmm.

...And let's not forget that 2 in the chest and one in the head has very little to do with caliber or even killing someone.

Two in the chest with anything from a .32 and up stops most people reflexively. The one in the head is for those that don't have that particular nervous response - somewhere in the 5-10% range.

At least you walked away from it.

More like 30-40% in African Americans and 15-20% in Hispanics. Sometimes that's due to drugs sometimes not.

also why put two in the chest when you can put one in the head and be done?

While one should be prepared to kill when discharging their gun at someone, that's not always the goal. If you're trying to kill them then, yeah, don't waste 2 rounds <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

I am curious where you got those numbers from of if you just made them up. What it is for Caucasians, Asians, Pacific Islanders and Other?

I think it would be hard to shoot someone in the head while moving or if they are moving. Most people can't do it on the draw when both them and the target are still.

This gun talk is getting off course of the main subject but its nice to see everyone has a little mall ninja in them  <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

Sorry guys, this thread is getting way off topic and potentially turning into something not fun.

Locked.
