## Demo scene / Chiptunes!
Posted by **nak** on Thu July 3rd, 2008 09:45:10 PM

I know the demo scene is pretty much unheard of in the US, but the same people who put on notacon have made a demo party in the US: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.demoparty.us/2008/">http://www.demoparty.us/2008/</a><!-- m -->

I don't know if anyone has been to either (notacon or block party), if so I'd like to hear about it.

Anyway enough with the jib-jab and GO with the chiptunes:

I made this today on a original gameboy running little sound DJ ([url=http&#58;//www&#46;littlesounddj&#46;com/:2njmwhjg]LSDJ[/url:2njmwhjg])
If any of you have suggestions for the song (title, music, etc) or tell me it's shit, it's all good <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

If anyone is interested in putting together a demo for next year's block party, I would be down to learn/help/explore and have fun doing it.

PEACE

been looking for a new guitar and wanna mess around with building my own fx and bending current fx 
but don't confuse me with someone with talent

Zeitgeist

Delusions of media

Bit Disaster

Im all tapped out of ideas, but I thought it was cool. I woud use it on my next YT video

Ah, those are cooler names than what I went with: TINAG (This is not a game)

I made another one with a crappy name: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.8bitcollective.com/items/music/HappySad.mp3">http://www.8bitcollective.com/items/music/HappySad.mp3</a><!-- m -->

@TD: There are a few sites that I've run across that have plans/kits for building your own effects, defiantly seems like that would be fun!

I found some of them sites
Wanna set up some of my noise making toys to be able to run thru effects 
Even thinking about making one of thoose electronic fart machines from spencers to run thru effects just for a laugh
Maybe call it Stank Fingers v1.0
Nak if you really wanna put something together im in.
Don't know much about demo block party and there website didn't have too specfic details so im guessing it pretty open to whatever.
