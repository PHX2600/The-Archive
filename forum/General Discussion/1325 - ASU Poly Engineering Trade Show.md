In case you're interested...

On December third around 1PM there will be a trade show in the Cooley Ballrooms just east of the student union.

Students will be presenting their capstone projects and independent study work.

Projects presented span a large range of disciplines from mechanical to software engineering and everything in between.

Entry is free and sometimes there are refreshments.

There has been a small change to the location of the presentations.

Full details below as sent to me.

   We've scheduled this Friday (December 3) from 1:30 till 3:00 for Fall Semester 2010 computing projects demonstrations. There are 3 masters projects being presented and three undergraduate projects. The projects are listed in the attached spread sheet. Faculty, if there are others, please let me know. Of course all (Engineering) faculty are invited to attend whether you are on a committee or not.

   Faculty, please invite any graduate students that you are working with to attend the demonstration. This provides an example for them when they reach their final semester. Generally the demonstrations are open to all who wish to attend.

  We'll use Peralta 213 for the demonstrations. Students, please plan to setup your demonstrations beginning at noon on Friday. You may use any of the group tables in the room. Please setup one project per table. If you have any special needs, please let me know. Most students prepare a poster board with roughly (the equivalent of) 10 powerpoint slides. Also setup whatever computers and/or devices that you need to show your software. Sean Dengler (who is the department's shop supervisor) can help printing your poster. He can be contacted via email.

   Graduate students, if you haven't provided your committee with a copy of your project report (paper) please do so as soon as your advisor OK's its distribution. Also, please bring the completed form: "Report of Final Master's Culminating Experience" which can be found at the web site: 
You should complete your name information as well as your committee members names.

Thanks,
