That sounds like fun, do you have a diagram so it can be replicated.

Hey McGyver, pics or it didn't happen!  Lol!  But seriously, a list of parts and
some pictures would be awesome!

Do you have many cattles that need a good prodding?  Sound's like an interesting
project, get some video of self tests ;)

He just needs to intimidate some physicist to pick up some cans.

pic will be up soon didnt get to finish it yet

list of parts though

  * 2 conductive bolts
  * a small electric fan
  * a disposable camera
  * solder and wire

the main part is really just the camera flash charging circuit minus the flash
cap as that puts out alot more volts but take longer to charge just ran the new
leads off of where i cut the cap off should get around 2000v the rest of the
parts where for the switch and housing for the circuit board

hopefully it will work

ok here is the update i got it to work for about 2 zap and now the voltage
output has drop a alot

tried new batteries still low out put

think it might be the fact that i used a pretty low budget (everything bought a
dollar tree)camera for the charging circuit

maybe a better quality camera might do the trick

ill have to do more testing but this was just to pass some time till my avr
programming shit came in

and UPS just dropped it of

i got the idea and plans from a book i got for my most recent b-day a little
while back

here is the link to the site

<http://atomiczombie.com/product-spygadgets.htm>

ill try to remember to bring my copy to the oct meeting( sept is meeting is on
my away team weekend at work so i wont be around) so anyone can look thru it

ok i got the cattle prod pretty much done (found out the cheap step-up coil was
not meant for rapid fire) and with a little reverse engeineering (very
little)and some google-fu was able to isolate the componets in the circuit which
make it work next step is to perf board my own circuit to make a more sleek more
sexy version of it and want to add a pot to the circuit to make it have
adjustable output

after that its off to the flea markets and junkyards in an attempt at making a
bargain bin laser range finder

Must have missed you + the prod at the Oct meeting. Are you going to bring it to
the Nov meeting?

the cheap step up transformer got fried during rapid firing and i haven't
replaced it yet

working on a laser listening device now that i hope to have ready for nov or dec
meeting

one day i'll put the ps3 controller down and do the schematics for the cattle
prod and post it on here

I am also hoping that it will work! By  the way, good luck for what you are
doing and hopefully, you can do it better!
