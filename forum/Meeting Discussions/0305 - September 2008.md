So is there going to be a September meeting on the 5th, then? 

What sorts of things should I bring? Due to being a starving college student, I don't have a laptop. (Though I soon hope to remedy that problem) I have a small collection of locks of varying difficulty, and a pick set I could bring. Do we have / need any presentations or whatever? 

Just curious as to how it all goes down.

@ AltF4

Bring whatever you want to share.  If you'd like to give a presentation, just say so.

I'm going to try and shift my schedule a bit so I can go to this meeting.  Hopefully I'll see you there.

Oh, no! I wouldn't be so presumptuous as to want to present on my first meeting! I'll just be there to hang out and hopefully learn some things.

Bring anything, it is a really chill open atmosphere not really like a meeting you would expect. More of a hangout meet and greet type deal. Its not like we sit around and pass the batton and take turns presenting info. Its more like you walk over to someone and see whats going on.Then before you know it there are several small groups of people chatting away about various things. Since picks and locks is my thing, I would say hell yea bring them along. Every once in a while I will pick a lock or two, but mostly I am talking and sharing ideas and technical info.

I will have a presentation soon. It is mostly hardware, but software is involved. I have worked on this one for quite a while, and it is easily my favorite project (even considering some of the others). It wont be completely &quot;ready&quot; when I present it. It is just barely ready now, although presentable. But I would like it to be more functional by the time I demonstrate it.

I will probably be ready to show and tell it on the Oct meeting, possibly September, but I'm not willing to write that much code in such a short amount of time.

Does anyone have a good wordlist? I've been compiling a collection of everything I can find, but it still seems kind of shallow. 

Perhaps we could share some lists at the meeting, or if nobody gets around to it, I could give out what I come up with when I'm done.

EDIT: Though I think I'm having an issues with repeated words... I'll likely have to hack up a quick script to eliminate repeats, but I can't imagine an algorithm to do so that wouldn't take ages.

I agree with that talk, but I have that wordlist already made, so might as well get some use out of it.

Also, I'll be bringing some old audio equipment to the meet that's up for grabs.

See it here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://flickr.com/photos/kankie/sets/72157606821129517/detail/">http://flickr.com/photos/kankie/sets/72 ... 17/detail/</a><!-- m -->

Nak already got the CD player, but I'll be bringing the Equalizer and the Receiver.

I'll be there. No talk, just chillin. No idea really what to talk about that I haven't already talked about. I guess I could...present my findings with nortan AV and race conditions. Or I could go over integer underflows in game server software followed by format string exploits in admin consoles for games like call of duty. Or I can do what I do best - stare blankly into space and mingle with my peers. The latter option is sounding good. If you have questions though, I'll be glad to answer them.
