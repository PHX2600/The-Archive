Anyone want it? I don't think I can sell it on ebay since I didn't see any other
listings for lockpick guns.  I've just been clearing out a lot of stuff.

It's this model: <http://www.defensedevices.com/lockaid-pick-gun.html>

I also have the pick guns book.

I'll take it off your hands, been wanting a gun for a while.
