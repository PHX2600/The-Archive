Rax wasn't the one selling these, they were sold at a computer equipment recycling company downtown, and when I picked up a couple for my work they hade dozens of them left.

I've been to Westech a few times, got some old SCSI cards and cables on the cheap.  PROTIP: Don't ask for a price on racks too many times; They'll give you a higher price every time you ask.
