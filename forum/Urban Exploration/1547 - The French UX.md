Wow!
I had no idea. I haven't read the whole thing yet, but here: [url:w7p1nbd8]http&#58;//www&#46;wired&#46;com/magazine/2012/01/ff_ux/all/1[/url:w7p1nbd8]

It's about a really hardcore french urban exploration gang that restores historical monuments, throws underground cinemas... wow... really. The stuff they pull off.  <!-- s:shock: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><!-- s:shock: -->

I think I've seen something like this on a UE documentary. I remember them covering UE in Glasgow, Istanbul, and Paris. Paris was the most interesting just because of how hardcore they were, and they did show some underground cave parties.
