This Saturday, April 7th, students from [url=http&#58;//0x539&#46;us:3k3jctsx][Buffer]Overflow[/url:3k3jctsx] and the University of Advancing Technology will be hosting Root the Box, a CTF-style hacking competition in Chandler, Arizona. We currently have 60 registered participants and are trying to get even more. This Root the Box will be the most impressive so far- we've been able to secure a huge location and will have more attack targets than ever. Admission is free and copious amounts of energy drinks and pizza will be provided. This competition will accommodate hackers of all skill levels, so everyone is encouraged to attend.
