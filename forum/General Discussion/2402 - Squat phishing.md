## Squat phishing
Posted by **dual** on Wed February 20th, 2013 12:57:39 PM

Saw a DJ on the net, Ang ger D imas, and with my crack powers of observation, noticed that the name and domain were one letter away from 'anger'. I registered the typo domain, mostly mirrored the original site, and added an 'email address for free music' form. I knew the chance of getting an unsolicited hit was slim, so I was quite happy to get two.

email=c**********%40gmail.com
email=v********%40gmail.com

Just a fun little experiment for a year.

This is sinister, but creative to a degree.  Also, you should style that email form better, make it stand out a bit. I almost missed it.  Might get more hits.
