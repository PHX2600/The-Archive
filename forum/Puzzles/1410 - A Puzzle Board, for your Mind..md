## A Puzzle Board, for your Mind.
Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Tue June 7th, 2011 03:00:55 PM

Hi All,

I decided it might be fun to periodically make some puzzles, maybe once a week
or once a month depending on difficulty and throw them up on the board here.
Just wanted to make a post with some generic rules for the puzzles.

Firstly, No posting the puzzle keys on the forums. If you beat a puzzle send the
key to me <Penguin2600@asu.edu> and I will record your score on the scoreboard.
Feel free to work together but keep solution methods off the forums, I want the
puzzles to be a fun and unique challenge for everyone. If you can scroll down
and see how it was solved previously the fun goes away. Hints are OK to post as
long as they are devious and full of doubletalk :). Many of the puzzles will
have additional instructions or opportunities to score additional points so make
sure you read the puzzle description before starting.

If you have ideas for more puzzles or ideas for the board definitely drop me a
line at <Penguin2600@asu.edu> or PM me on the board and we can talk.

Thanks and have fun,

-Penguin

No one so far. I was considering migrating the puzzles to another site with a
php backend for scoring and such. Like our old whitecoatlabs stuff.

FOR YOU I recommend the binary. Puzzle 2.

    1 = Crypto
    2 = Binary
    3 = Stego
    4 = Sockets
