## Predators got sick

Some of our military drones and predators got a virus. My favorite part:
“We keep wiping it off, and it keeps coming back,” says a source familiar with the network infection, one of three that told Danger Room about the virus. “We think it’s benign. But we just don’t know.”

Crap like that does not raise my confidence in our killing machines at all. If there were a skynet, don't leave it to our government, Terminator would have malware...or...maybe that's how skynet would start in the first place.

Anyway, source:

Oh man, why would anyone allow that to be said. Makes our tech people in the military look pretty freaking bad. <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: -->

It's possible the infection came from a soldier playing a little bit of Mafia Wars:

In reality, this assumption is made because the virus is a keylogger that typically targets/phishes the demographic of Zynga like games. So it's not really a proof, just more of a likelihood that the soldier was playing some facebook games unsafely.
