I'm in, I am thinking an article on rooting androids (What root is, why some phones cannot be rooted and methods of rooting), since really I am a cracker and not a hacker. But you guys know I got love for the community.

Yea, totally. I'll contribute to this. It's a really good format for "Cool things, but not quite so cool that they would get picked up at a conference" items.
