## ReCaptcha... HURRAY!
Posted by **PHLAK** on Wed December 23rd, 2009 06:29:35 PM

With the update of the forum last week comes a much needed update, the boards
are now using ReCaptcha for all captcha based needs (ie - registration).  If you
happen to notice a non-ReCaptcha captcha, please notify me with a reply to this
post or an email to <phlak@phx2600.org>, thanks.

ReCaptcha not working right, reverted back to the regular captcha for now.  Will
get ReCaptcha up and running eventually.
