## Drawing/Illustration Skillz?
Posted by **dxh** on Tue May 19th, 2009 05:53:49 PM

GENTLEMEN! (and ladies)

I am designing an awesome generic Arizona hacker shirt, mostly just for teh lulz.  I have a rough sketch of what I want illustrated, but rough sketching is as far as my illustration skills go.  Anyone here have cartoonist-esque drawing skills?  The design I have in mind will look somewhat webcomicy (think Penny Arcade, Hijinks Ensue, etc). Lemme know if so...

Can you snap a pic and post it?  I have some graphics design skillz, but the way you're describing it I'm not so sure I'd be able to do it.

Depending on how good the sketch is, you may be able eo just run it through a vectorizer online and be done.

Very true.  I'd give that a try first.

My sketch sucks, but anyway here it is:

Its Basically V is a McCain suit, taking off a McCain mask with the AZ Senate in the background... which doesn't actually make sense since McCain is a federal senators, but whatev.  There are also 2600 and DeLUG flags in the background, and I was also thinking of including rows of V's where the state reps would sit in the background and maybe playing wif the AZ Seal logo a bit.

Isn't McCain like so last year? I'd probably put the new star trek movie in the mask
Get witha times!

I have an acquaintance that just offered to do commissioned sketches and regular comic work in exchange for cash. PM with your email or myspace and I can pass it along.

Do you mean V as in the 80's movie visitors, or am I just completely out of touch?

I wouldn't mind attempting to draw something if you have particular ideas.  I'm pretty rusty, but I use to do fairly decent sketches - I guess.

[b:sui23tfq]&quot;Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation, stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin van-guarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you and you may call me [size=125:sui23tfq][color=#BF0000:sui23tfq]V[/color:sui23tfq][/size:sui23tfq].&quot;[/b:sui23tfq]

Remember remember the fifth of November
Gunpowder, treason and plot.
I see no reason why gunpowder, treason
Should ever be forgot...
