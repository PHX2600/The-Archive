## Captcha not showing for failed login(s)
Posted by **fightgar** on Thu May 12th, 2011 11:52:27 AM

The captcha for trying to login too many times doesn't show up, I tried logging
in on my other (main) name and it seems like either you have the attempt limit
set to one or someone has been trying to hax "nak"

Anyway, the captcha didn't show up, so I gave up and just signed in, I sorta
like this name, maybe I'll stick with it or start another account ;) jk

Well, I just tried starting another account, and that's disabled, which I can
understand.  Probably to stop spam bots and feds from getting in here right? ;)

I am sorta sad that I can't get into my "real" account ;3;

I believe registration is back open, FYI.  If not, or if you have problems, let
me know.
