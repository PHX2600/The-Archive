## Burn .avi files to DVD for playback on a DVD player
Posted by **PHLAK** on Sun November 16th, 2008 04:01:38 PM

Does anyone have a tried and true method for burning .avi (usually DivX) files to DVD for playing on your typical DVD player?

Previously I've used Nero to do this, but Nero has since become bloatware and I've removed it from my system.  I'm specifically looking for a free way of doing this, but if you know of any way at all, please let me know.

For which OS? 


DeVeDe works if you don't want menus.

I've seen good results from convertx as well.

Very nice, I'll keep that in mind if I plan on doing any DVD burning on Linux.  However I was looking for a program for Windows and have since found one that works great, it's called DVD Flick, check it out:

Doesn't everyone's plan include burning DVD's on linux? 

There is, however, a windows binary available for DeVeDe.

Thanks for the link to DVD Flick. I'll check that out as well.

The neat thing about a Mac? It's the only unix box out there I know of that plays/converts *all* of the major media formats.

VLC and ffmpeg aren't just for Linux...

I use Nero Vision, the thing is pretty damn full proof with just about every codec under the sun and have had it repair some badly damaged video files before a burn.

Also has a menu maker and editor only issues is that you know you have to buy it or not =P

Thanks for the suggestions, but if you refer to the original post I mention that I used to use Nero, but it's since become bloatware.  I have since found DVDFlick ([url:1mff9znv]http&#58;//www&#46;dvdflick&#46;net[/url:1mff9znv]) to do the job rather well and not bloat my system.  Thanks again though.

PS - Welcome to the forums!
