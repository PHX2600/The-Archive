Don't see why not, spring break coming up.

maybe you guys could help me with this fancy take-home style midterm.

I haven't received it yet but here's one the guy gave last semester, pretty awesome.

Lol, Penguin. I like the Midterm questions. Most professors I know are afraid of (or don't know of) using &quot;hacker lingo&quot;. They never talk about shit like &quot;snort, x-mas tree scans, etc..&quot; Lots of theory... 

lol, except this one time this older professor of mine was talking about Back Orifice... and you could totally tell that he didn't get the double meaning! He had the name and logo up on his slides, and the class bust out laughing. He had no idea...

All over it.

Anyone know how to use the open source program Sugar?  for CRM specifically.

I'll be honestly, I'd take this job, but I'm not great at the programming aspect.  It would be to set up a program from scratch using Sugar to create a CRM (which they weren't certain as to what it was).  But it would be to create trouble tickets for call center; it would require: log notes - times - names and easy access for any random person off the street that would be at a call center.

Alright, that's enough for me.  I'll try to keep up on this site, so hit me back.

I'm new in town. I went to the last meeting. 
I was the loner sitting at the table drinking tea. 
I should have introduced myself but I didn't know who was who or what was what.
I'll try to make it to the next meeting and I look forward to meeting some of you.
Does anyone also go the local OWASP meetings (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phoenix</a><!-- m -->)?

Blah... Looks like I'm going to be judging for AcaDeca on Friday. I forgot that it was meeting time... I wonder how late everyone will be there? I may show up late. I'm not sure when I'll be getting out, though.

I still have all the presentation videos from last Defcon on my laptop if anyone wants them. Sharing is caring, you know.

AcaDeca?  Is that related to the student org DECA, by chance?

If I can get copies of said videos, you will be my official hero for the month of March.  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->

lul!

Ehh, I got a scholarship from them, so I feel somehow obligated to help'm out when I can now. 


As for the videos, I'll try to make it. But I may not get over until like 9:30-45ish.  For future reference, I've got a red laptop with an EFF sticker on it. (I'm looking for more cool stickers, btw) Hit me up if you happen to see me. I'm really bad with names and remembering this sort of thing. <!-- s:? --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><!-- s:? -->

Ask and ye shall receive.

Which Defcon videos are you referring to?

I remember Academic Decathlon.  Does Olympics of the Mind still exist as well?

All the presentation videos (and slides. They have the slides matching with the presenter) from DC16. It's actually just a bunch of ISO's from the DVD's. The video files themselves (inside the ISO's) are .mov's iirc. Great quality, so it's like 6-7 gigs altogether. 

...maybe I should just burn the ISO's to dvd's and hand'm out, lol! <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

Was going to offer access to some DC stuff, wasn't asking for copies, but thanks.  

I'll bring stickers if I make it Friday.  Lots of stickers.

Welcome, sorry you can't come to the meet today.  Hopefully we'll see you there next month.

Also, no, there is no age requirement.  We've got babies at these meets on a frequent basis.
