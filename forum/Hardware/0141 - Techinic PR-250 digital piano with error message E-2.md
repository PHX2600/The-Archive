## Techinic PR-250 digital piano with error message E-2
Posted by **kilo** on Sun July 6th, 2008 03:54:30 PM

I got the email and while I didn't have an idea of what to do next, I figured I
might ask if any of you are more familiar with 22 pin floppy drives:

> I have a Techinic PR-250 digital piano that can play many instrument sounds,

22 pin floppy sounds like the old macintosh floppy connector; which seems right
as their floppies were manufactured by matsushita (read panasonic) so you might
be able to swap out for a mac floppy drive and get it working. If not, call up
Guitar Electronics and ask Gary Lowe what the error code means. I *might* even
have one of those floppy drives around, but I wouldn't count on it.
