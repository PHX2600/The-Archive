## strategic ajax for seo
Posted by **hexatex** on Tue February 16th, 2010 01:06:05 PM

I haven't heard anyone suggest this in any of the tutorials, blogs etc that I have read, but I think I have an idea thats worth considering.

From what I have heard crawlers such as google bot has a hard time loading ajax data on the page, if can at all, so I was thinking, what a great way to remove irrelivent text and data from googles eye.

For example, I have several &quot;side boxes&quot; on the right side of my store pages, one of them being a shopping cart box. There is no need for google to follow any of the links in this box, or even view its text, so perhaps it would be better if I loaded this &quot;side box&quot; with ajax into a div, so that it is not in the initial page text. This could also help avoid google assuming something is duplicate content, with text that is included with the basic layout of every page.

I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on the idea.

Yeah exactly,

I strategically Ajax my kitchen appliances like that to prevent bacterial and fungal crawlers from ruining my kitchen content.

But seriously that sounds like a pretty solid idea. We could do a study setting up multiple identical sites, some with Ajax, some without and try to determine the impact.

Might make for a good paper.

LOL!


@hexatex I think that would work.  It would get rid of filler words and increase the density of a pages keywords.  Though like penguin said, some data to support it would be nice.
