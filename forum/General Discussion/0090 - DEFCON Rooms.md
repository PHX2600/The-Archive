zaph and I might go to Defcon this year. My birthday is August 5th and we are getting married around then since that's when my insurance [thru my mom] runs out. And I always wanted a really tacky Vegas wedding, if I ever happened to get married. Super tacky.

So I pitched the idea to my dad and hey it might happen. And since Defcon is the 8th thru 10th we may as well go.

Yey.

Oh he will be coming with. He really loves to stare at lights so we figure Vegas will be super interesting to him! Plus why wouldn't he be at our wedding?! He is part of the family!

ETA: Or did you mean who is going to watch him part time while we do other things? I dunno, probably my parents or a random Elvis impersonator. But I can never be away from him for too long cause he's breastfed and he does not take a bottle with pumped milk at this moment in time. He's like WTF DO NOT WANT @ bottle.

Well don't feed him the whole array at once, silly. Try:
[code:1brqvygi]foreach $myBottle (@bottle){
feedBaby($myBottle) || die "could not feed baby:$!";
 }
[/code:1brqvygi]

If you ignore all the wintery clothes it pretty much looks like us too...

Something to think about if you're getting married in Vegas at Defcon...

Two of my friends got married around Defcon time (one of them in Vegas), now sometimes Defcon falls on their anniversary. So, if they go to Defcon, they can't kick it with the wife, or vice versa.

Oh man. We aren't getting married AT Defcon. What do you think we are, nerds?! 

We are getting married at the Starship Chapel by Spock.

The funniest reaction so far has been my parents, who said "Don't you think it's going to be kind of hot in August, in Las Vegas?"

The worst part? _They moved about 20 miles south of Phoenix in 2005, so its not like they don't know..._

The Riviera seems to be sold out.  I really wanted to check out their signature rooms, too.  <!-- s:cry: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very Sad" /><!-- s:cry: -->

Damn. Gotta turn to family now. <<shivers>>

Holiday Inn Express, maybe?

Looking at Vegas.com, it seems there's still actually room at the Riviera, but at $438.70/night, which is about what I paid for at Shmoocon two years ago... at the Omni... I really need to start booking early...

Will I go? I dunno. I didn't book a room, but I has lots of cash. Maybe someones feeling *nice*. We can work something out.

Fuck!

Why didn't I pay more attention to this?

I'll be in training for my new job starting Aug. 4 Mon-Fri. That means I can't go.

I reserved a double occupancy room and it appears that I probably won't need it. It's reserved for Thursday, Friday and Saturday night and the first night+taxes have already been put up. At least one coworker wants to go and will probably want to use it, but we should be able to put some more folks in there. Send me a PM if you're interested in getting in on it. Not sure how many places to sleep there will be so be prepared to make do. Special consideration to individuals willing to give my coworker a ride. <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->
