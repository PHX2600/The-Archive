Yeah, I am looking into getting into lockpicking. If anyone has any pointers they might be willing to share... what sort of picks are worth buying and that sort of thing or any experience they may want to dole out please let me know, and hopefully we can talk a bit about it at this coming meeting (Jan 4th).

So you know, I have dabbled a little with lockpicking, and have unlocked a few locks and do know generaly how it works, but it just seems like I am lucking out. I can not look at a lock and say for sure I can pick it or how long it will take me. Thanks again.

I have a clear lock, I might be able to bring it. I have learned a few tricks with it. For example, I have been able to push all of the pins way above the sheer line, then take the pick out, and then with the correct tension alone, slowly let go until the lock turned. It makes way more sense when you can actually see it.

Well as far as picks, the few of us that hobby it out, have southernord pick sets, which in my personal opinion they have some sturdy picks. I believe the website is[url:14ez31vg]http&#58;//southord&#46;com/[/url:14ez31vg]

Well, high strength spring steel picks are typically gonna last longer and put up with more abuse. In terms of pick tips, you may wish to decide if your going to focus primarily on &quot;Raking&quot; which doesn't require a whole lot of skill. If you have the ability to &quot;Feel a Lock&quot; where you can create an image of the inner-workings of the lock in your mind by touch, probe, or other methods of examination, Then Picking will be easy for you. The first thing to do if you want to know how long it will take you to pick any specific lock is to get well acquainted with the multitude of different locks, there are quite a few so do your research. Go to the hardware store and pick up a lock or two to play with. Practice. Also A couple of intresting techniques you can use are:

I am going to give you the best advice and all of the reasons why. This question has come up millions of times over the years, I am giving you advice from my own personal experience and advice from some of the oldest and most knowledgeable locksmith that was passed down to me.

Picks to buy, buy the Best, or as close as you can afford.

Peterson by far makes the best picks on the market. They are the most durable, use the strongest, and highest quality steel that will give you excellent feedback becuase they have very little flex. They also have a variety of different grips. They will last forever and will probably out last you.

HPC Picks, best for the money. Not very many different grips but they make up for it with a variety of different pick designs. Excellent quality steel and feed back. Very sturdy pick construction and same price as the lower quality Southord, Southern Specs, or any of the other entry level pick brands. They are a little harder to get for hobbyist becuase of the inflated price and lack of variety. If you know a locksmith or have access to a supplier you are good to go.

Don't use cutaways or other clear visual aids in learning how to pick, your main goal is learning how to visualize the lock threw touch. Start out with 1 pin in the lock, move its position around until you feel comfortable picking it. Then add another pin and repeat the process. This has been the best proven way to learn lock picking. It will get you familiar with the different components that make up a lock, and give you practice re-pinning. Practice Practice Practice is what will make you a better picker weather or not it is SPP, Raking, Rocking, or Jiggling. In reality you need to be versed in all aspects and different picking techniques. 

If you want a lock for practicing get a Kwikset Smart key lock. You can easily change the pin stack with the change key. It will give you thousands of different combinations of pin stacks to practice on. It is also a more challenging lock to pick than a standard Kwikset with the traditional pin tumbler setup. They are like $20 and well worth the money, they are also bump resistant.

If you have questions on an exact set you are looking for tell me your budget and I can recommend a great entry level set and tell you the supplier who will give you the best deal. I have owned and purchased many different pick sets please learn from my mistakes and at my expense.

I'm currently catching up on the forums (haven't read some posts in a while), but you are contributing some great info. I hope to see you at the meetings again.

My first set of lock picks were home made from an allen wrench that i had grind down for a torsion and some picks bent put of the metal part of a windshield washer blade and the little bristle things that street sweepers use. it worked pretty ok nothing special but did get me my keys back when i locked them in my car trunk.

That is interesting, you can also make tension wrenches out of the window wiper blade inserts. I make every effort to not pick automotive locks becuase the wafers inside can be easily damaged. Hacksaw blades, feller stock, and steak knives make decent picks. The problem is when you are beginning, it is better to learn with proper tools. It makes the learning curve much easier on yourself. Some locks are so worn that you can almost stick anything into them and they will pop open.

I just got my first pick set. Thanks xLogicx. I can pop those little gold locks by master lock so far. Some seem to be easier then others. There is this big master lock at the bottom of my stairs that the previous resident left. The maintenance guy, instead of bringing some bolt cutters was sitting down at the bottom of my stairs with a fucking dremmel grinding away at this thick ass lock at like 9 AM on a sunday morning. And you can bet I told him to fuck right off. Well, I was trying it yesterday and I was having trouble getting the pins to move up, it seems like it has been outside so long that it is a little stuck from being seasoned by the weather.

Try spraying a little Tri-Flow into the cylinder that should break up whatever crap is in the lock and rake it a couple of times with a snake pick to loosen up the pins. Generally you want to try and stay away from WD-40 when it comes to locks.

What about graphite powder lube?

Posted by **ThatGuy** on Fri January 23rd, 2009 04:45:20 PM

You can try graphite but its very messy, it seems to get everywhere. I am not sure how effective it would be breaking up corrosion and grime. Lots of other products will work or have the same effect. I recommended Tri- Flow because I see it sold everywhere. A dry film lube is the best for locks but its also more expensive.

So where's everywhere, like at the local grocery store, there is a checker across the street from my place.

I like the picking thing. I am getting use to the inside. I got this little gold one and It's like muscle memory to get it open. I need to get a few different ones to practice on. I thought I had some but I am not sure where they are at.

Off hand I have seen it at Autozone, Home Depot Lowes, ACE, Wal-Mart, and a few other specialty shops.
