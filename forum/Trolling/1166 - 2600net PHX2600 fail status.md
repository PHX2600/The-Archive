## 2600net #PHX2600 fail status
Posted by **jargon** on Mon December 7th, 2009 01:12:19 PM

Please send private messages to r0d3nt on the 2600net IRC network asking him why no forum members of [url:28r1ivcj]http&#58;//phx2600&#46;org/[/url:28r1ivcj] have founder access to #phx2600 despite under Emmanuel's own rules about channel naming guidelines that #phx2600 is a private channel.

Emmanuel's official guidelines state that official 2600net 2600 Hacker's Quarterly monthly meet-up IRC channels must have 2600 with the two letter country code following and the two letter province/state code leading, with the exception of states in the United States not requiring the trailing country code, with the exception that the main 2600 channel has no prefix or suffix, and that any other IRC channels on 2600net containing the text &quot;2600&quot; in the channel name be privately operated channels on 2600net.

My suggestion to allot 3 letter or 4 letter international airport codes in front of 2600 as an official channel was never ratified by Emmanuel despite putting it on the table every year since 2004.

Obviously, the man wants it to be a fucking private channel.

So why does r0d3nt claim the channel is to be owned and operated by Emmanuel despite Emmanuel strictly claiming it to be a privately owned and operated channel on 2600net?

r0d3nt's story is that I have simply been sitting on #phx2600 meaning he claims I gave been squatting on it meaning he is claiming I have been keeping it to myself without doing any proper upkeep and meaning he claims I haven't been opping anyone else on the channel.

I have been granting ops on a regular basis of the few who enter, keep the topic up to date of current events, even so much as putting a warm greeting and simplified true-to-spirit of PHX2600 guidelines along with a channel description matching current events.

It took me 3 weeks to come up with a formula for #phx2600 topics on 2600net that always fits, yet always has all the important info:

short description of group, website of group, time/date of next meet-up, address of meet-up, description of adjacent building.

Since a topic only fits a max of 160 symbols on 2600net, you can see why this took 3 weeks for me to come up with a formula that works every time.

Here is the formula as follows:
{spc} is a space.
Text in &lt;&gt; is part of the madlib.
/ is a madlib option separator.
There are no line breaks nor carriage returns in the topic, they are just presented here for readability's sake.

[code:28r1ivcj]
Humble Central Arizona Lamers
{spc} | {spc}
&lt;site url&gt;
{spc} | {spc}
Meet-Up&#58;
{spc}
&lt;month name&gt; {spc} &lt;day of month&gt; &lt;st/nd/rd/th&gt; {spc} &lt;hour&gt; &lt;am/pm&gt;
{spc}
@
{spc}
&lt;shop name&gt;
{spc}
(
&lt;building number&gt; {spc} &lt;N/S/E/W&gt; {spc} &lt;street name&gt;
{spc}
just {spc} &lt;north/south/east/west&gt; {spc} of {spc} &lt;adjacent shop&gt;
)
[/code:28r1ivcj]

(This is an average range of 140 to 160 exact characters.)

Best channel join greeting that fits:

So, despite Keal's jibberish and trolling and abuse of 2600net and it's users..

Anyone is welcome to use any channel they want. However, if a 2600 channel is being used to cybersquat on the channel, troll it's users,  I've received many complaints from phoenix users as well as general 2600net users, I'm forced to take control of it.

Generally all of #XX2600 #2600XX channels are founded by Emmanuel, this is purely symbolic, and if users contact me to assign ops or request help, if they are up to the task, I'll assign a SOP &quot; super op &quot;. Keal requested this, but no, I'm not interested in giving him control over any channel that represents 2600 in any shape or fashion. If another user from the area would like to help maintain that channel, feel free to contact me.

Keal's misunderstanding about how 2600net works and how the ircd and services work, I can't help him. I've dealt with him and his jibberish for years now. I'm not the only administrator of 2600net who feels this way.

Feel free to message me on irc.2600.net if you have any questions. 

After a couple years of dealing with Keal, I am quick to tell him no, and quick to ban him. Patience of the users and the network runs out pretty quickly. Usually I only deal with him when I get complaints.

He's a waste of time, skin, breath, and text. Sorry Keal. Stay on your meds pal, and I wish you the best.

Sincerely, 

r0d3nt

r0d3nt doesn't know what the fuck he is talking about nor how 2600net works.

I used a 2600net IRC network backdoor to update the channel description, topic, URL, access list, etc.

Channel descriptive information:

If you want on the channel access list, please come to [url:2b7ilngz]irc&#58;//djslocker&#46;2600&#46;net/phx2600[/url:2b7ilngz] (or any other hub/server of 2600net, and register your screen name along with sending a private message or memoserv message to Keal via the 2600net IRC network or a private message via this forum to jargon requesting being added to the access list.

Which of SOP/OP/HOP/VOP status will be assigned depends on your past history on IRC in general, the [url:2b7ilngz]http&#58;//phx2600&#46;org/[/url:2b7ilngz] forums, various PBXs &amp; other party lines, various hackerspaces, and attendance and quality of behavior at the various conferences &amp; DEFCON / 2600 meet-ups especially the phx2600 meet-ups.

plain &amp; simple: If you are a dick your access list rank will be lower, you do not have to be a phx2600 forum member or phx2600 meet-up attendee to gain #phx2600 access list status so long as you help out, contribute, or are otherwise friendly.

Hints:
Kilo will be a SOP once he regs his screen name.

XlogicX and PHLAK will become AOP if they ever reg and use the IRC, (Just AOP due to not wanting to create a phx2600 monopoly due to monopolies not being in the best interests of the group; the &quot;r0d3nt&quot; post above is a prime example why monopolies in the 2600 community in general are a bad idea!)

Happy hacking &amp; hope to see you on the IRC! <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: -->

btw:

[url:2b7ilngz]http&#58;//phx2600&#46;retromachineshop&#46;com/?Section=Hours&amp;Hours=Unlimited%20Coffee[/url:2b7ilngz]

Notice that Unlimited Coffee was open from 6am to 6pm on December 31st 2008, and open from 6am to 2pm January 1st 2009.

We may may have to either reschedule the hours of the January 1st 2010 PHX2600 meet-up, or else change the location for just January 1st 2010.

I still have to verify with THE BEST BARISTA IN THE WORLD what the actual Unlimited Coffee open hours will be New Years Day 2010.

There are only five days of the year that Unlimited Coffee has shorter hours: Independence Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years Eve, New Years Day. Normally, Unlimited Coffee is open 6am to midnight every day.

Cheers!
