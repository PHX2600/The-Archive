All of these domains are open unless otherwise noted.

[b:24kq23qa]hackadeal.com[/b:24kq23qa] - Generic

[b:24kq23qa]dumpsterdiveteam.com [/b:24kq23qa]- inspired by NaK's shirt ( I think he handed rights to it to jinx though )

[b:24kq23qa]notahacker.com [/b:24kq23qa]- based on rax's shirt.

[b:24kq23qa]bobparsonsisafag.com[/b:24kq23qa] - I laughed so hard, this is actually a live domain and points to parson's site

[b:24kq23qa]feelingused.com [/b:24kq23qa]- kind of funny
