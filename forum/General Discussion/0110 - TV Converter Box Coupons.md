Hey NaK,

Has you or anyone else in the group bought one of these converters? Has anyone opened up a converter box and looked inside of it?

I have a theory about it but my electronics knowledge is rusty at best. <!-- s:mrgreen: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><!-- s:mrgreen: -->

I have heard some rumors that the devices are bidirectional, that they will have the capability of transmitting information back to some kind of intelligence gathering center.  Why else would the government offer $40 coupons for all the poor folks? Besides, TV is one of the greatest brainwashing devices - you can't beat that.  I might start having my own thoughts if I didn't get my daily network news.

Because companies get a kick out of funneling tax revenue from the govt to their bottom line. As an added bonus, the average price of the converter boxes probably went up between 0 and 40 dollars, giving them an additional boost from sales of non-coupon boxes.

It was pitched, however, as a fix for the large number of people out there that purchased a perfectly good analog TV without knowing it was going to become obsolete in 2009. Many of the folks that aren't interested in the latest and greatest television are the same ones that get the most *real* use from it (not watching american idol and the like)

As for reporting back, if it's OTA digital they'd have to either plug the converter into something like a phone line or be transmitting the info out via RF. Either way, it should be fairly easy to spot. They aren't necessary for Cable or Satellite as the FCC mandate is specifically for Broadcast television, so back feeding on coax wouldn't be an option.

Can you elaborate on that?  The $40 coupon isn't a tax, it's an expense.  It's also fiscally irresponsible IMO.   Do we really need TV that bad to function  as a society?  Of course not.  But it is needed to keep the established order, and the propaganda flowing.

The 40 dollar coupons are beans compared to the RF spectrum the government will be able to auction off for billions of dollars! Thats what I am thinking...

Digital transmission takes up less bandwidth (I think channel 8 has 4 digital channels 8-1,8-2 etc)

Who's up for some pirate digital TV!!?!

I'm saying those coupons are essentially $40 of government money (collected through federal taxes) that go to the companies selling converter boxes.

Were it not for the emergency broadcasting system, they probably wouldn't have bothered.

Yes, it's lame that we're probably paying for it in taxes.  But as far emergency broadcasts, I would think AM/FM radio would already cover that.   
Maybe it's just what Nak is saying, but like invading another country, there is usually more than one goal.

While they still do the emergency broadcasts over radio, at any given moment, I'm sure there are significantly more TVs on in homes across the country. When it's something important like that, you have to cover the bases. It's pervasive. Makes it useful for good things - like news aggregation, emergency broadcast, entertainment, and bad things like propaganda and trite anti-intellectual programming of all stripes.

I haven't opened one up yet but as far as i can tell form what I've read and heard it appears to work much like a modem in ways with converting digital to and analouge signal. It converts the new digital signal to a useable signal tvs can use. Satalite tv boxes are already doing this.
