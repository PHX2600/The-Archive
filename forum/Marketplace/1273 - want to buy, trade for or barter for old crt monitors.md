I have an old, possibly working 15&quot; CRT I can part with.  What sort of price range you looking at?  I can bring it to you at the next PHX2600 or HeatSync Labs meeting/hacknight/meetup if you'd like.  $5 sound reasonable?

You gonna be at the next HSL or PHX2600 meeting?  If not, I can just hand it over at some random place, like Moderate Bean, super-shady style from the trunk of my car. <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->
