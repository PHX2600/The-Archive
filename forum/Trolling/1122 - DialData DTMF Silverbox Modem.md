## DialData DTMF Silverbox Modem
Posted by **jargon** on Mon September 28th, 2009 02:57:23 AM

Description:

Here is DialData version 0x002. This work is created by "Timothy Robert Keal
alias jargon" as coded using freeBASIC, and is released under the "Gnu Public
License 2.0".

To use:

Drag drop plain/text files onto the program icon in order to send bytes at
roughly 8baud of DTMF dial tones using 2 DTMF tones per byte through the sound
card output. This DialData DTMF Silverbox Modem release version does not yet
SEND/RECV; it only SENDs.

To recompile:

  1. Ensure your paths are correct and extract the install folder into the
     fbsound folder. (Ensure the root folder of the install results as a sub
     folder in the fbsound folder.)
  2. Use freeBASIC to compile using the **-s gui -mt** compiler options.
