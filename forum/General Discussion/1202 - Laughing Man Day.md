## Laughing Man Day
Posted by **dual** on Wed February 3rd, 2010 09:44:03 AM

Fourteen years from now, 3 February 2024, the Laughing Man incident occurs. A super-hacker who comes to be known as the Laughing Man kidnaps the head of Serano Genomics to force him to admit to suppressing the real cure for cyberbrain sclerosis in lieu of Serano's profitable micro-machine treatment.

This incident is the basis for the Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex (GITS: SAC) storyline. Its significance here is that it is a map of human existence and interaction on the Net. Granted the overarching theme of the GITS mythos is the speculation of the existence of a soul, or ghost, in machines and cyberized humans, full cyberization bounds the issue as the human consciousness becomes a node on the Net.

Evidence of the evolution of Shirow’s story is plentiful and grows daily. Multitudes are just now inkling with the idea of ubiquitous, omnipresent Net access. Simple-yet-formative technologies emerge daily that change human presence and are labeled “social networking.” Developments in bioengineering and cybernetics are now tested on the unfortunate, soon purchased by the wealthy, then expected for the masses.

Posting on hacker forums, I believe I am speaking to the choir and that most here can sit back with arms folded and watch with calm the fast-forwarded video of technological development and the flurry of people coping as if it were slow motion. If you’re not convinced, here are a few indications to the day.

Frontline’s Digital Nation: Life on the Virtual Frontier, which premiered last night, 2 February 2010.

Colbert’s Word for 2 February 2010: Cognoscor Ergo Sum (I Am Known, Therefore I Am) a diatribe on emerging social networking technologies and the struggle of those screaming into the ether to be known. These are simply steps to moving the human consciousness online.

So where from here? Again, you’ve likely seen GITS and this isn’t new to you. Move along. If you haven’t, seek out this politically, technologically dense series and note the advancement of net infrastructure, bioengineering and presence as a whole. Tell others, keep it to yourself, it doesn’t matter. Just keep hacking. Happy Laughing Man Day.

Thanks, Zap. Btw, it's even more relevant this year with the recent passing of J.D. Salinger.

I was always wondering what that laughing man was from! I was about to watch boogiepop phantom again, but now me thinks Ghost in The Shell.

Thanks for this post Dual, very good material.  I've never been a big anime fan, thus never saw GITS, but may have to check it out after reading this.
