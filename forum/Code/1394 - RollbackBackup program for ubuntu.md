## Rollback/Backup program for ubuntu
Posted by **fightgar** on Mon March 28th, 2011 11:56:00 AM

Hey everybody,
I don't know how many Ubuntu users are here but there's no easy way to &quot;rollback&quot;(RB) to a previous version of the operating system after upgrading.
I was thinking that would be a neat project to start, including a way to just rollback certain updates.  I've had things break after particular updates and having a utility to show a calendar of updates and present rollback options would be so helpful.

Since I am familiar with python I might just start banging out some code in that just to get familiar with the particular log files the package manager uses to keep track of all the updates. etc

Desired Features:
[list:2s9e2jjv]RB Package installations/updates
RB to a previous kernel
RB to a previous Ubuntu release (This is the one that would be the most important)*
RB config files
Backup and restore user's files[/list:u:2s9e2jjv]

*as of now, if you update to a newer release and don't like it or it breaks something, users have to do a complete re-install to get back to the previous release.

Let me know of any ideas or if anyone wants to help out trying to figure out that all worksies (or if there's an application out there already)
