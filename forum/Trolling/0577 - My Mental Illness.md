## My Mental Illness
Posted by **jargon** on Sat October 4th, 2008 02:11:31 AM

tonight i got owned
i spent a lot of money on dinner and a date with my ex
then i find out after bad sex she is still seeing someone
meanwhile i was paranoid any given other felon in her apartment were going to shoot or stab me
worst thing the guy she is still seeing goes to the same mental health clinic as me :(
and he is some psycho native american guy
so now i have to change mental health clinics
&gt;:/
and i am now prolly all full of stds despite wearing a condom
i didn't enjoy the sex at all because i knew something was fishy
i am giving up on love

doesn't help that my dad treats me like trash every day
doesn't help that my little brother tells pretty much everyone he meets how stupid i am
it's not my fault my iq is dropping 8pts on average a year
in another 10 or 15 years i will be a vegetable at this rate

:(

at-least my neurologist was able to reproduce the behavior in my brain in which i go partially blind by figuring out what induces it
apparently when i go damn near 100% i end up having an outer body experience due to being 100% cut off from my stimuli
and that is why i keep having premonitions and experiencing 'temporal displacements'
apparently just watching a tv show like csi miami is enough to set it off

:(
hell eventually it will get worse to the point of just seeing the no walk signal at an intersection could set it off, while i am driving
the other month the power went out due to a **massive** lightning storm and while approaching a 4 way blinking red signal i nearly ran over a cop that just looked like a spatial distortion to me :(
the neurologist thinks it might be retinal migraines
i think it is also combined with some form of epilepsy though

:(

meaning i may very well not even be mother fucking schizo
hell i might not even be bipolar

the epilepsy would explain why my iq went from 173 at age 5 to 118 at aghe 27
i've only done drugs a total of 30 different days in my life at most
doing drugs 30 different independent days out of 27 years would not cause a 55pt drop
hell you could smoke crack all day long 30 back to back days and not have a permanent 55pt drop

i am pretty sure the only thing wrong with me is retinal migraine induced epilepsy along with the brain damage caused by such

Damn bro, sounds like you're having one hell of a time.  I hope you're doing alright!  For real though, remember, none of us are perfect and not all days are great, but you can get through it.  I've been in your shoes, as far as getting cheated on goes...  Shit sucks man, I felt pretty damn horrible.  I damn near took my own life.  And for what?  Some stupid little girl?  I pushed through it though and now I'm much better off.

Hope you're feelin' better

IQ usually drops significantly when you're under stress.  It's limited in what it measures as well.

I have no idea what that was about, I think I was mental that night due to getting involved with a chick again that was bad news. She called me the next day after I posted that and claimed I stole her room mate's credit card. Like sheesh! Cheryl is the one that steals cards, not me. <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: -->
