Did anybody see this? It's a new web browser from google, introduced in a web comic.

I read the comic, what a good idea to make all the ideas that went into the browser accessible.

I also just downloaded the browswer, haven't tried it yet... google is taking the world!!

Yeah, tried it out a bit.  Still a little buggy, but fast as hell!  Google did one hell of a job on this browser, and hopefully Mozilla will take much of what Google's done (i.e. - separate processes per tab, being able to pull a tab into a separate window) and incorporate it into their Firefox.  The only thing that Chrome needs in order for me to consider using it as my browser of choice (besides several bug fixes) is add-on support with AdBlock Plus.  Then, and only then, will I actually WANT to use it constantly.

I haven't run into any bugs yet (and no I haven't been fuzzing it either, just using it)

What have you found dude?

You tried chrome? so Google owns you now right?

&quot;a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute any Content which you submit, post or display on or through, the Services.&quot; 

that's a pretty cool license  <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P --> 

I think they changed it already but c'mon.

I play some of the role play games on myspace, you know the ones that are almost exactly identical except for the text strings. They seem to just replace Short Sword with Glock kind of a thing. Anyway, mobsters,mafia wars and heroes were all fine, but dragon wars looks like crud with google chrome. Some sort of issue there.

Indeed they did change it [from Slashdot]:

[quote:ok2uhvao]
&quot;In response to the reaction to Chrome's terms of service, Google has truncated the offending Section 11, apologizing for the oversight. The new Section 11 contains only the first sentence included in their Universal Terms of Service, now stating: 'You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Content which you submit, post or display on or through, the Services.'&quot;[/quote:ok2uhvao]

This is also retro-active, meaning it affects anyone who installed it before the change too.
