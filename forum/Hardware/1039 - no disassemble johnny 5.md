It's a razr, I don't think there's anything you can do to make it work... even
if it wasn't smashed :P

It was good to me for 5 years, not one problem.

I will miss it.

Want mine? It's T-Mobile but that shouldn't be a problem. I can't stand the

Nahhhhhh, I'm sort of against the whole "I spend more money on my phone each
month than my entire electric bill" kind of thing

I meant my Razr.

I'm going back to my Samsung as soon as I put it back together.
