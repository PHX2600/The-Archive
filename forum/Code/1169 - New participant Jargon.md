## New participant: Jargon

Phlak and I decided to give Jargon access to the Code forum for ‘good behavior.’ He wanted more access, and the code section is the best limited topic that he has the most interest in. He has been told to stay relevant (and keep the rest in trolling).

We encourage everyone to use the ‘warn’ feature if he becomes a problem (the triangle with the !). However, we will only consider the warnings that have an explanation, and only count the ones that are reasonable.

Here’s to hoping that this is beneficial to all parties.
