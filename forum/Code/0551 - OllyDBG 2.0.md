Wow! I had no idea until today, just got a new hard drive installed and needed to get Fireworks CS3, but all the keygens had this &quot;horst&quot; trojan in them, so I decided to get some OllyDBG and figure out if I'm smurt enerf to get a key/activation myself (I doubt it... but hey gotta try) and found they had released a new version of OLLY!

I tried it, deleted it and downloaded 1.1  <!-- s:| --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><!-- s:| --> 
No hardware breakpoints in 2.0 yet (its in alpha)

And no luck on the keygen, I found the section of code that does the key-checking, but I don't know how to get a keygen out of that.

I would assume the keygen is a small windows gui.  If you have by passed the code for the trojan or changed the EP to start where the real program is then it woud be a matter of setting a breakpoint in olly on commands that would show the key on the screen.  Well that would be my guess on it, and of course I could be way off on that also, not seeing the program first hand.

Yeah, I didn't mean disassembling the keygen exe, I was REing the macromedia installer, I didn't want to RE the keygen because I didn't have a system setup that I didn't mind getting infected.

I just set up a Virtual Box with micro XP and ran the keygen in there, I guess I could RE the keygen in the VM and make clean versions and put up a torrent <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->
