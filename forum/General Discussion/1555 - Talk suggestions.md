## Talk suggestions
Posted by **nak** on Sun February 19th, 2012 01:21:09 AM

I KNOW there are knowledgeable people who would probably give some wonderful presentations, but haven't (or don't very often).

I figure'd I'd start a thread where we could post talk suggestions and people could step up and take a suggestion and turn it into a reality.

My suggestions:
[list:1tscau6n]1. Language primers: Every language has a purpose, the more you know, or know the case-uses for, the better programmer you can be (ie, one hasn't written an MVC web framework in assembly, or has programed a 16 bit microcontroller with Ruby [or... well... [url=http&#58;//rad&#46;rubyforge&#46;org/:1tscau6n]Ruby-&gt;C-&gt;machine... neat[/url:1tscau6n]) Know of obscure, not so obscure languages, frameworks, libraries that people should add to their toolkit?

2. Git(hub): a quick run down for git familiarize the audience with basic syntax/vocab/methodology: push, pull, commit? FORK?!

3. Electronics primer or specific concept: PLL, Reactive circuits, 555, transistors, radio, specific microcontroller?
4. Digital logic primer

5. Philosophy of 'hacking' how the term has changed, been bastardized, marketed and will return... baptized! <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->[/list:u:1tscau6n]

Hope I left room for suggestions, feel free to &quot;2nd that&quot; or &quot;I'll try to do one on XYZ&quot; thanks

I've always been a kind of software guy, so everything to do with microcontrollers and hardware hacking always seems arcane to me. I'd love a talk about the basics of some that kind of thing.

Phlak knows git really well. I know it somewhat, too. But he's been doing it for much longer. Plus, it's hard to beat this talk about git:

It's pretty much just 1 hour of Linus making fun of SVN and CVS. Pretty awesome.

Time to watch this now that badge has been laid to rest.

I've been contemplating doing a talk on Git/Github but have been putting it off for a while.  Maybe I'll actually do this (though probably for the April meeting).
