I was reading a lengthy article from sophos on the unravelling of the Koobface network (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/koobface-2/">http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/koobface-2/</a><!-- m -->) and came across an interesting website called namechk.com. It's nothing spectacular, but a neat little tool for seeing where you're handle is populated on the web; as far as accounts go. I just like watching it thread out and search them all.

Sweet find! Hacking around a little bit with it, it seems to give some definite false-positives, but in general I'd say it's a handy tool to finding out if your handle of choice is in use somewhere or not ... would be sweet if it checked e-mail / instant messenger services, too. 

Also, I can totally see this being (ab?)used to trax down folk by username ... id est, Joe Haxor find a username/password combination for Myspace, run namechk against the username and checks if the password he's got matches other services that user might have an account with. Since a lot of (better-written) login prompts just return "bad username **or** password", something like this would let Joe know that the user most likely existed ...

**Edit**: Here's a list of the domains that seem to be generating false-positives. I got this by telling namechk to search all possible domains and then mashing the keyboard into the username box. The link on the right is to the alleged profile for the username "ba13lknsdnmawlk3jlknadflkjasnlnlsalkdfn".

That's pretty informative ArchAngel, with the keyboard mashing results. I wonder what's happening behind the scenes there. As far as the abuse of tracking down usernames of haxoren, this is what some analysts did to track down Krotreal of the Koobface facebook worm...according to the article I found this website in.
