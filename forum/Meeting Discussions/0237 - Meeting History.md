## Meeting History
Posted by **ThatGuy** on Sun August 10th, 2008 09:30:20 PM

Anyone going to update that bad boy, meeting section or photo gallery? That was one of the first things I looked at when I was contemplating going to a meeting. It is sort of a symbol saying, yea we meet and people attend and have a good time. It also helps to identify a few friendly faces. I have noticed at meets you always see people looking around with that lost look in there eyes. I know that look becuase I was one of those people at my first meeting. Maybe we could get a sign or something to put at the table that says reserved for PHX2600? I have also seen new people show up and leave becuase no one is there at the meet time. It is sort of obvious who is there for there first meeting vs a normal customer. I usually ask people and introduce myself, but I am also a loner and not a meet and greet peoples person. Just a few ideas from a newb, and where can I get a PHX2600 shirt?

Agreed. I updated meeting history for this last month and plan to keep up on that aspect. Although, PHLAK also has some WordPress plans for meeting history (possibly). In the mean time, I will try to keep that up to date.

As far as pictures, if nobody is taking any, I will try to take some more.

As far as the shirt: <http://shop.cafepress.com/phoenix-2600>

Do we want to update the shirt with **PHX2600.ORG** logo rather than .com?

Just a thought, we don't have to, .com redirects to .org anyway.

makes sense, but I'm too lazy to change it. I may if I get bored though.
