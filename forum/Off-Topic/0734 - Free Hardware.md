## Free Hardware

Hi all

I haven't been around lately. Well, I've been around Phoenix, but life keeps getting in the way. LOL

Anywho, I have some hardware that I'm looking to find a new home for.

1 Dell PowerEdge 2300 Server.  ID tag 2FJ0N  
(Go to dell.com/support, and click on "Warranty Information" on the left-hand side. Enter the ID number, and when the results come back, click the "Original System Configuration" to see the specs.  

The box has been around for a while, but I thought that someone might want a server-class machine to play with. Keep in mind that as a "server-class" system it's LOUD. The fans move a lot of air!

I also have a PII (that's Pentium II for the kiddies out ther) machine that I had in storage.

Additionally, I have an HP LaserJet 6p (with some toner left in it), that I haven't used in forever.

I'd like to see this stuff NOT end up in a land fill.

Drop me a note if you're interested.

I ought to be able to make it to the February meeting.

Seriously considering the PowerEdge... but I'll let you know.

Also, what comes with the PII?  HDD size?  Total memory?  Also, how many PCI (or EISA) slots?

Ya got me! I forgot that I even had it. I think it has a SCSI card, and a TV Tuner. I had MythTV running on it at one point.

The PII will fit in my car, the Dell won't. So, if you want the Dell, you'll have to stop by my place to get it after the meeting.
