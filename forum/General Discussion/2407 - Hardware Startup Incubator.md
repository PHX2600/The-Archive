## Hardware Startup Incubator
Posted by **twitterkilo** on Fri March 22nd, 2013 01:34:52 AM

That "@assembleAZ" thing hosted a wordpress meetup; and one of the guys there mentioned wanting to setup a space where Hardware Startups could have a home. He didn't yet have something to announce (like "watch this twitter profile" or "go to xyz.com and get all the news about it"), but I asked him where I could go to check back on it later on, and he told me to google "Special Computing" and the address in Scottsdale comes up, and this website:

<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.specialcomp.com/">http://www.specialcomp.com/</a><!-- m -->

I'll try and get more info as it becomes available.

Interesting, seems like it's really in an alpha stage of development right now though.

More of a store front for OSHW than anything else at the moment.  Tindie spun up about a year ago: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tindie.com/">http://tindie.com/</a><!-- m --> and seems to be fairly successful so far.
