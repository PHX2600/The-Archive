I was at B&amp;N a few months ago, and I was checking out the network (trying to avoid that damn ATT pay for access crap) and I decided to see who was on line. I ping sweep, and found another nodes mac address. I spoofed it, and I did another ping sweep, and I saw a kiosk this time that wasn't on when I was on with my mac address. I would have tried to do more with the kiosk, but It was getting late, and I didn't want to get too far in, only to have to go when things got interesting. Does anyone have something interesting experience with B&amp;N networks? My fun was at the one at the Chandler Mall.
