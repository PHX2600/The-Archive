## SEO
Posted by **hexatex** on Mon February 15th, 2010 01:48:18 PM

Anyone know anything about SEO?
I'm working a gig doing seo for mardi gras costume shop (<!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mardigrascostumeshop.com">www.mardigrascostumeshop.com</a><!-- w -->) 
I know there are some obvious things I need to do to the online store to make it get better traffic, such as add more, fuller content for the products, etc...
anywho, so far I have:
*forced www. in the url via mod_rewrite
*put &lt;link rel=&quot;canonical&quot;&gt; tags on all store pages
*made url friendly urls
*did a scan for missing pages or 302 redirects
*put nofollows in links that lead to dupplicate versions of pages (such as sorting options)
*created a product, and category sitemap (paginated to avoid looking like a link farm)
*created an xml and txt sitemap for all the major searchengines (and of course submitted them)\
*Made the title of all product pages automaticaly generated from the product name, thus fixing a massive duplicate title issue
*removed ajax links in several places to help with crawling.
*Uploaded file list onto google base
*started link building campaign

I'm not sure if it violates any forum rules to ask for anyone to check out the site, but if you could check it out and give me any suggestions, it would be greatly apprecitated! <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mardigrascostumeshop.com">www.mardigrascostumeshop.com</a><!-- w -->
(sorry for my horrific spelling, typing in a hurry <!-- s;-) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;-) -->

No rule breaking going on here IMO.  Also, here's an excerpt from a doc I wrote up for my boss last week (most of it you already covered):

Search engine ranking and your web sites traffic are directly influenced by four main areas:

[size=150:ufintv78][b:ufintv78]Content, Links, Popularity and Reputation[/b:ufintv78][/size:ufintv78]

[b:ufintv78]Content:[/b:ufintv78] The more unique, well-versed content a site has, the better it will rank.  Content primarily consists of the text on your site, but also includes images, videos and anything else the users come to the site for.

[b:ufintv78]Links:[/b:ufintv78] Mainly concerning inbound links, but also includes outbound links and internal links.  The more, quality, inbound links a site has, the better it will rank.

[b:ufintv78]Popularity:[/b:ufintv78] The more people that know about your site the better it will rank and the more traffic you will receive.  Popularity is often measured by the number of inbound links to a site.

[b:ufintv78]Reputation:[/b:ufintv78] Popularity alone is worthless without a good reputation.  If a site is known by many to be of poor quality or of little to no use to the users it will not rank well.


[u:ufintv78][b:ufintv78]Top 10 SEO tips[/b:ufintv78][/u:ufintv78] [color=#999999:ufintv78](These were based on a specific websites needs, but apply to all websites)[/color:ufintv78]
[list:ufintv78]
[*:ufintv78]Content is king, period. Make sure you have good, well-written and unique content focused on your primary keyword or keyword phrase.[/*:m:ufintv78]
[*:ufintv78]One keyword phrase per page.  Don't try to optimize a page for several keywords.[/*:m:ufintv78]
[*:ufintv78]Use a unique, keyword-focused Title tag on ever page. Do not stuff the title with unneeded keywords.[/*:m:ufintv78]
[*:ufintv78]Match page content to Title text.[/*:m:ufintv78]
[*:ufintv78]Natural language content ranks better with search engines.  Don't stuff your text with keywords.  This method does not work and can hurt your rankings.[/*:m:ufintv78]
[*:ufintv78]Use keywords and keyword phrases appropriately in text links and image ALT attributes.[/*:m:ufintv78]
[*:ufintv78]Quality inbound links are better than many poor links (which can actually hurt you). &quot;Remember, if there is no good, logical reason for that site to link to you, you don’t want the link.&quot;[/*:m:ufintv78]
[*:ufintv78]Don’t be obsessed with PageRank. It is just one part of several attributes that go into the  ranking algorithm. A site with a low PageRank can outrank one with a high PageRank.[/*:m:ufintv78]
[*:ufintv78]Search engines like fresh content (ie - DotD, blog, etc.), be sure to add new, useful content to your pages regularly.[/*:m:ufintv78]
[*:ufintv78]Understand social marketing. It IS part of SEO (Yelp, Facebook, Twitter, etc).  Building good customer relations through social marketing will help build your sites reputation.[/*:m:ufintv78][/list:u:ufintv78]

[b:ufintv78]Note:[/b:ufintv78] You will never get over-night results from SEO optimization.  Be patient.  It could be several weeks or more before you notice any change in ranking.

[u:ufintv78][b:ufintv78]Other SEO Tips to consider[/b:ufintv78][/u:ufintv78]
[list:ufintv78]
[*:ufintv78]Use SEO Friendly URLs.  (ie - yourdomain.com/spacelys-sprockets.htm)[/*:m:ufintv78]
[*:ufintv78]Every website should have a sitemap, but not rely on it.  A search engine should be able to find every page on its own.[/*:m:ufintv78]
[*:ufintv78]Eliminate those nasty 404s. No one likes getting to a page that isn't there.[/*:m:ufintv78]
[*:ufintv78]Avoid duplicate content and/or duplicate URLs pointing to the same content.[/*:m:ufintv78][/list:u:ufintv78]

Putting filtered mass year after year of 24/7 IRC logs from thousands of channels so that hyperlinks are able to click through, having 100% of the text with individual per single symbol having a random generated font size and capitalization per page view teeniebopper style, and rigging a plain text hit-counter independently into every damn page, using a directory structure-style navigation panel alongside actual natural language content, using file-system instead of a database service such as MySQL, and continuously adding new content in massive waves....

WILL MONOPOLIZE YOUR RANK WITHIN 8 HOURS OF THE CONTENT INITIALLY GOING ONLINE.

Trust me, it was a dirty tactic I used with SERIALSIXES.NET, OMNISIS.ORG, and MEDIAPLAGUE.COM in the tail end of last decade.

It is a Google bomb technique I taught to Chinese and Russian hackers in-exchange for fandom.

[b:2g7x4446]No.[/b:2g7x4446]  Not only will most of this have little to no effect on your page rank (font size/capitalization, hit counter, file-system vs MySQL), some of it is down right dirty and might be considered black hat SEO and get your page banned from search engine rankings.

PS - Please refrain from posting unproven tactics while stating they &quot;WILL MONOPOLIZE YOUR RANK&quot; and also refrain from making unreasonable/far-fetched claims such as &quot;It is a Google bomb technique I taught to Chinese and Russian hackers in-exchange for fandom.&quot; You have been warned of this before and promised you would keep posts on topic, relevant and honest when we gave you access to this forum.  Thank you.
