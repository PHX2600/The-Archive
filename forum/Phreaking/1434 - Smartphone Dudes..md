Why haven't any of you written a &quot;manual war dialing&quot; software for your personal use? Or is that illegal, even doing number logging/increments? Press next &gt; [DISCO] [NIS] [PERSON] [FAX] [OTHER] &gt; press next number + 1

I would've on my treo755p but it costs 100 bucks to get the resource editor for onBoard C (which seems like the only way, its event driven completely...)  I've looked around and haven't found any completely open source magic <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( -->
