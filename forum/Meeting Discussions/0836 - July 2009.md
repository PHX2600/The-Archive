Meeting this Friday, who's going? I imagine many people have the day off, so there's no excuse not to come!

I had a good time at the meeting. had to take off a little early to get to fry's for an exchange. So after I saw everybodies Mini PC's i decided to make a change. After I got home I created a windows 7 usb boot disk and installed Win7 on my dellmini9. Then I got PDAnet for my android and pc and tethered my connection. Am posting this from mydellmini9 with a tethered 3g connection through my android on windows 7.

Victory is  mine!!

Aw man I missed the baby unveiling. We were having company over that night but then they couldn't make it. We'll go to the next one hopefully?
