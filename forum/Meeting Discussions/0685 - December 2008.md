School pretty much owns my soul for the next week or two, so I'm afraid I'm not going to make it. Finals...

sorry we didn't make it. we forgot again.

but to be fair, two nights before the meeting a guy we knew, a neighbor, died. he was dead in his condo for a few days. it was kind of eerie because we have this huge window in the 2nd bedroom which faces his place so we saw a lot of stuff with the cops go down just through our window alone. i saw them taking pictures of the body... well sort of. there were flashes behind the drapes so it was obvious what was going on. before that though it took them an hour or two to even get in his place. 6 or so cops stood there by his door forever. they were interviewing neighbors. zaph saw the cops pick the lock of his place though. i guess if it's not an emergency situation they don't bust down the door. then the first cop who went in started kind of wretching/gagging. i didn't see this part. i think i was doing baby maintenance. anyway so zaph went outside to talk to some neighbors and he saw a paramedic get waved away. we left sometime before they hauled the body out though. i texted my neighbor when it was all going down and she got to see the bodybag. when we got back home around 10 it was if it never happened. that was the weirdest part.
