Posted by **nak** on Thu July 21st, 2011 05:17:24 PM

Forums seem to be not very popular any more.  I don't go to any forum besides this one.  Anyone working on any projects or have any neat ideas?

I'd like to hear <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

Not yet, just learning crap over here. I'd like to get good with perl still. May poke back into ASM again

Well I've tried to post some stuff but I have to get admin approval or somethin's like that. I kinda left after checking this place for 2 weeks and not feeling any sort of social attitude. I'm only looking at this (and replying) because I saw some of my posts got approved.

I'm experimenting with reducing my sleep per day, primarily using micro-naps.  I was originally sleeping 8 to 9 hours before I started.  Currently I'm at 5 hours with one micro-nap (as of today).  I was hoping this would improve my overall energy, and it has, even if I still don't feel 100%.

Polyphasic sleep? I started doing that as well, but my schedule wasn't very flexible.  I did like it, however...

Well, I just read one article on the subject of sleeping 5 hours and decided to roll with it.  The premise of the article was that just about anyone can adapt and sleep better in less time.  You can also train yourself to sleep longer.  I don't think I've successfully achieved only sleeping 5 hours yet, but I've definitely reached 6.   Not sure how Polyphasic sleep works exactly, but I think that's a bit different from what I'm doing... as I'm basically sleeping for 5-6 hours and taking one micro-nap (usually about 15 minutes) on some days, but not every day.   My schedule is basically getting up at 4am, and carrying on with a normal day.  This is very unsual for me, as I use to always be a night owl of some kind.   I think this works better for me mainly because I probably have sleep apnea which makes me tired the longer I sleep, and also have some weird thing where I go into a paralysis mode sometimes (sleeping past 7 hours I guess) having a very hard time waking up.   I've  been working on improving my sleep habits all my life... so this time around I'm quite pleased with the results I'm getting.

Well shucks! Welcome friend!  Are you in the Phoenix area? I'll have to check around to see if you have an &quot;Hi, this is me and my introduction thread&quot; -- most members seem to have twitter accounts if you're into that sort of thing.

The forums maybe locked down a bit to keep out spam-bots, talk to PHLAK about getting to post without admin approval (you seem pretty human to me so far <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) --> )

@CultLeader; sleep paralysis is no fun, I've had it for over a decade now, and started getting it right after experimenting with sleep myself. However, I have noticed patterns that increase the likelihood of an episode (being that I've had paralysis several hundreds of times). There are 2 main things that will make it more likely that I will have an episode: sporadic sleep patterns, and sleeping in a high alert state.

So, if I take some oddly timed naps, it's likely I'll get paralysis in one or all of them.
If I fall asleep knowing that I need to wake up on short notice at any arbitrary time, or am sleeping when I know I shouldn't or something along those lines that I call &quot;paranoid mode,&quot; I am more likely to have an episode.

So, if I'm taking a &quot;forbidden nap,&quot; I pay.

However, I'm desensitized now, I have sleep paralysis for the lulz these days. I actually figured out strategies to stay in the nightmare of a state longer (the secret is to fight it; conversely, if you want to escape an episode, accept the state that you are in, don't fight).

Well, those were my 2 cents.
