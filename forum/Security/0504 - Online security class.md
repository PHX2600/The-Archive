## Online security class
Posted by **Rax** on Sun September 21st, 2008 05:25:08 PM

Many of you know that I teach technology classes at one of the local community colleges. Thanks to the fantastic economy (everybody say "Thanks, W") they haven't been making lately.  So, I decided to start offering some of them myself.

The first class is an Overview of IT Security topics. The class will prepare a person to take the CompTIA Security+ class. Make no mistake, the Security+ cert is pretty tough to get. It's not a Mickey Mouse (tm - Disney  <!-- s:roll: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><!-- s:roll: -->) test.

In any event, this class will be delivered twice a week, online, using GoToMeeting. You'll be able to see my screen (or yours, if we share it out), hear the lecture (there's VoIP built in to the application), ask questions, etc.

The lectures will be online, and most of the labs will be done offline (i.e. you do them on your system). We'll be using VMWare and the demo version of Windows 2003 server (both free for the download).  Free programs and/or demo version of other programs will be used throughout the class, so you won't need to purchase any additional software.

The "text book" is also the lab book, and it's available online. It's kind of pricey ($150), but you might get creative in how you would "go in" on the purchase of the book with someone else (ahem).


**There is no college credit associated with this course! ** I'm offering this class  on my own. In my 8+ years of teaching community college classes, I've found that most people taking IT classes are more interested in the knowledge and information, rather than the credit.

Classes will be twice a week either Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday, and will be in the evening. I've yet to determine the days. When this course is taught at the college it is a 4 credit class (just to give you an idea of the amount of time/material that is covered). The class will last approximately 8 weeks.  I'm looking to
start the week of 10/6/08.


I will run the class the same way that I run my college classes, so it is a "formal" educational experience (i.e. it's not just going to be b.s.ing about the topics). There will be "tests" but they're more to let you know what things you need to review (and what things I need to cover better), so there's no worries about "test anxiety."


For this first version of this class, I'll make it available to Phx2600 people for a **_substantial_ ** discount!

If you're interested in joining the class, or want more info, please send me a private message.

How about you outline the class and go over it at the next meet? It will make an excellent presentation and give us a reason to attend. 

I wish I had the drive to write a book, but it wouldn't be a certification book.
