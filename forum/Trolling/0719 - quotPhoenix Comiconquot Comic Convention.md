Does anyone know if tickets are valid for all 3 days??

jargon's little brother 'lingo' might go too if our mom decides to take him in a different car.

Carpools:
1. XlogicX, mattie
2. alias jargon (aka &quot;Mr-Keal&quot;), Evil1, RetroTech1541
3. &quot;Mrs-Keal&quot; (jargon &amp; lingo's Mom), lingo (jargon's lil' brother)

Remember &quot;2550&quot; is Saturday, Jan 17th at *noon* at Unlimited Coffee if people want to plan together. Also, jargon might bring a sewing machine and other junk to make cosplay stuff out of. jargon and RetroTech1541 plan to go as Jay and Silent Bob.

I think mattie and xlogicx are going on ___friday___ the 23rd of January 2009. I think mattie said their tickets cost 20$ each last phx2600 meet-up on first Friday, January 2nd, this 2009; and that means the 23rd by ticket price.

However, I am not able to confirm this, because mattie, I don't think, is a member of this board, and xlogicx is being a clam-shelled jerk and is returning everything in pm while avoiding information regarding phoenix comicon.

(If it turns out that xlogicx simply doesn't want me to go the same day as them, that is his problem, the convention area will be huge.)

BTW, last phx2600 meet-up was a fluke; nobody seemed to be on the same page as each other on the bar end of the coffee shop center table. :/ I didn't post my presentation on my site, because I only showed it to one person, and the presentation wasn't finished being written yet.

Okay, it is official, PHX2600's Phoenix Comicon meet-up date is January, Friday the 23rd 2009.

Call 480.323.8892 for Mister &quot;Keal&quot; alias jargon (my cell phone number) if you are lost at the Phoenix Comicon Convention and can't find the rest of us. ..Yes, area code *480* for my cell.

[quote=&quot;Disclaimer:&quot;:c9amssi9]If people abuse this number I will keep the phone turned off except for maybe every hour and half hour on the hour and half hour, naval time (Sprint time) for Arizona. Blame &quot;rooperator&quot; from irc.2600.net #telephreak if my battery ends up dead if Comicon doesn't have outlets for people to recharge their phones. I will seriously start &quot;star eighty-sixing&quot; people that repeatedly abuse my number. Which means yes, your line does eventually end up flagged for the police and FBI as harassment. And don't bitch at me if eventually it gets to the point that the Defense Intelligence Agency extradites your ass.

And don't forget that it I really needed to, I could simply Tyler Durdan your ass, anyways.*



*This means causing mass hell in your personal affairs. I own <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://dearosamabinladen.com/">http://dearosamabinladen.com/</a><!-- m --> and <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://openwmd.org/">http://openwmd.org/</a><!-- m --> for Christ's sake. It wouldn't be that difficult for me to provide &quot;sound evidence&quot; that you work in a terror cell. Providing &quot;sound evidence&quot; pointing toward me having been so, would prove rather fruitless. I really have nothing to lose here anyways, nor do I have reason to give two craps about people that call me every 30 seconds while spoofing DC numbers and sending bogus busy tones. I could care less and simply screw your ass the way &quot;Storm&quot; screwed Kevin Mitnick.[/quote:c9amssi9]

Remember, single-day tickets for that date have Wonder Woman on them and cost $20 USD each when bought at an exquisite retailer such as &quot;All About Anime&quot; at Metrocenter Mall. horray! ^-^

[quote=&quot;Disclaimer Disclaimer:&quot;:c9amssi9]Okay, obviously you people that are calling don't realize the behavior in the Disclaimer is a satire intended to imply you not do that type of crap described in the reconciliation part of the disclaimer. 

Whoever called my father at his house either from a bogus number or else spoofed my own number to pretend kiddie crap was going on; This is the exact type of bull I was implying to *not* pull.  &quot;Rooperator&quot;, &quot;vk4akp&quot;, and most importantly the self-described &quot;federal agent&quot; known as &quot;lamerjoe&quot; all from irc.2600.net #telephreak; The latter of the three individuals being in my eyes the most-likely jackass pulling shit about falsified underage illegal activities: What is your malfunction??[/quote:c9amssi9]

We saw pyramidhead there, etc.

We didn't get there until after 4pm, and by then all the presentations were over, and we never had a chance to yell 'NIGHTCOURT' at Brent Spiner (&quot;Data&quot; from StarTrek because he wasn't there Friday anyways. we left at 8pm when the exhibition hall closed (exhibition hall closes sunday at 6pm)

I did my usual thing freaking people out until the cops came and started following me around.

we never ran into logic and mattie even though the convention area was pretty small.

took us 20 minutes to find a place to park.

food is damn expensive, and you have to pay for food with cash i think.

no pics  because i couldn't find the camera.

i ended up going in street clothes as did retrotech, however they though he was cosplaying as silent bob anyways, and people thought i was cosplaying as solid snake.

i am not sure but by brother (lingo) and my mom prolly forgot to go even though the tickets were 50$ for the two of them for saturday.
