## Phone Trips
Posted by **binfordman** on Sat February 7th, 2009 02:46:18 AM

It looks like one of my favourite sites phone trips.com hasn't been updated in a
while. I heard Evan is going though some problems and the site hasn't been his
top priority.

No recent updates though. Just what I got from emailing them not too long ago.

Actually there quite a few updates. Just check the last modified dates at...

<ftp://ftp.wideweb.com/GroupBell/>

Or the red ***NEW*** and ***REMASTERED & REVISED*** labels on the front page. :P

Edit: You can also get Phone Trips updates at the BinRev forums, as in this
thread...
