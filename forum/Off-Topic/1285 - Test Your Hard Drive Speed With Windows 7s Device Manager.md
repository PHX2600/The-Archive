I came across this on my own fumbling around, but had a hard time finding it again.  It's a useful feature in Windows 7.   Under Windows 7 I find I'm re-discovering things that were already available in XP, so it's possible that this is one of those. <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

Just remember, go to [u:1uffmkun]controllers[/u:1uffmkun] in the device manager menu, not [u:1uffmkun]Disk Drives[/u:1uffmkun] (though right clicking properties will give you some useful tools there as well).
