I'm pretty sure most of you have heared about it by now, any thoughts or
opinions?

Also, some rumors flying around that you may be able to score one for $99 if you
have an "old" Google account.  Source:

Hope this is true, my Google account is ~5 (maybe more) years old.

We like ours. It is a hacked google android phone, though it is not the newest
"droid" phone. Are you just talking about the new droid or any google phone?

This is a phone STRAIGHT from Google.  No carriers in between.  Lots of news out
there on it, look up "Google Nexus" on any search engine and there's all sorts
of news on it.

Here's one such article:

If it does what it claims to do I think this may change the mobile business and
open up lots of exciting avenues.
