## ARM Cortex SoC workshop at Avnet 7/1/2010
Posted by **joey** on Fri June 25th, 2010 10:33:31 PM

Hi y'all - this is my first time on this forum. I'm new to the hardware game and
have a few projects I want to get started. I'm accumulating crazy-powerful SoCs
and gadgets (Android) faster than I can deploy anything custom to 'em. !!!
:evil:  So I figure this is a good crowd to hang with.

Anyhoo, my bike geek friends tipped me off to a SoC workshop at Avnet on the 1st
(next Thursday). $50 gets you  an ARM Cortex SoC board (worth 100 bux) with
adaptable IO ports, on-board Ethernet, munchies and maybe some useful training .
I'm stoked.

I'm gonna try to make it out to the monthly meeting on the 2nd too, if anyone
plans to be there.

edit: damn bbcode.
