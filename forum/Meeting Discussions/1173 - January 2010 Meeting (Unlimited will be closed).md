I propose we find another place to meet for this meeting, but we'll need to make sure the place is open.  I will personally check with Lola's coffee if they will be open on the evening of the 1st, but would appreciate it if you all could come up with ideas and times.

Perhaps we should try for a 2600 new years party. I mean, if we're all hanging out at midnight, it does count as meeting on the first Friday of the month <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

I like your thinking.  Any ideas?  Where will be somewhere that's open all night we can meet up at?

I'll see if Conspire is open then; Its similar to the way the Willow House was, but more RADICAL.  Not sure about Gamewerks; They're kinda turned more watch-football-with-country-music when I was there last... in 2004.

Pretty sure Gamew(e||o)rks is an 18+ or accompanied by an adult type deal after 10PM. Since the bar part is isolated they don't have to do the 21+ thing.

Posted by **PHLAK** on Fri December 18th, 2009 11:29:13 AM

Do we have any members that aren't 18+?

It won't really matter, they'll be with responsible adults...

Via Jargon, Gameworks will be closed New Years eve: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://www.phx2600.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=1181#p3656">viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=1181#p3656</a><!-- l -->

Hmmm. I'd give them a call, as that conflicts with their posted holiday hours:

*Edit*
I called and they confirmed they'll be open on new years eve and new years day. If anyone else wants to call and see if they get a different answer, feel free. 480-839-4263

So has a decision been made?  Where/when are we meeting?

A source has revealed that Gamewerks is reserved for a private party. Haven't investigated, but what about this:

I called yesterday and they said they would be open till 8:30pm on new years eve.. guess one would need to speak to a manager because employees are giving out diff/wrong information.I asked if they were closing for a private party she said &quot;no, we are closing for new years eve duhh&quot;.. lol, i'm serious <!-- s:ugeek: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_ugeek.gif" alt=":ugeek:" title="Uber Geek" /><!-- s:ugeek: -->

Is Gameworks going to let laptops in? I could see them saying no at the door...

Hey guys!

I've been following this thread and recently, I have spoken to a rep at Gameworks. Her name was Debbie and when I asked her about tonight's hours she said that it was closed for a private party at 8:00 pm.

Query - Did any of you book the party there at Gameworks? If not, are any of the members meeting somewhere else? 

I got the 1st Friday off from work (a once in a blue moon event) and I wanted to stop by and visit.  <!-- s:mrgreen: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><!-- s:mrgreen: -->

This is sounding bad. Why don't we just do the meeting next week? I know it's not a first Friday, but what kind of hacker group is afraid of breaking a little rule or two?

My handle is &quot;twitterkilo&quot;? Wow I did not remember signing up for that.

Well I stopped by Gameworks at about 5:50pm to discover the mall was closing at 6pm, but Gameworks was still open. I hung out and checked the arcades, kind of a loud place. Apologies if I missed you.

Anyway, I called up Jargon and told him to call me when he got there.

There were rooms where it looks like we could have had &quot;meeting places&quot; called &quot;1 Play&quot; and &quot;2 Play&quot; but I declined to open the doors and check it out.

Anyway, Jargon called me back to ask what street it was on, and I told him if it was just us, let's just meet at Denny's. (i'm unsure of the exact time, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://twitter.com/imkilo/status/7285169053">http://twitter.com/imkilo/status/7285169053</a><!-- m --> twitter tells me &quot;about 3 hours ago&quot;.

I'll catch you guys next month.

Also: Gameworks is probably a good place for going to play arcade games, not sure if it would work for our meetings (loud) unless we could get into a room.
