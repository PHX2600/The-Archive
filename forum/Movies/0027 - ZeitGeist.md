## ZeitGeist
Posted by **PoH** on Tue January 15th, 2008 12:26:06 AM

Hey guys, not sure who has or hasn't seen this. I myself happened upon it kind
of by chance, doing random searches on google, google videos, youtube, etc.

The name of the movie is Zeitgeist. In German in means something close to Time
Ghost. It is quite the interesting movie, broken into three separate parts,
covering various topics.

The entire movie is on Google Videos, and I'm sure various other places.
Deffinately worth the time to watch it. I am wanting to see if I can buy the
actual movie really, so I can show it off that much easier.

Enjoy.

Zeitgeist is an absolutely amazing move!  Though not 100% accurate, the message
of freedom and not to trust the media/politicians is EXCELLENT!

Yes, Zeitgeist is litterally translated to mean "time spirit(ghost)", however, a
zeitgeist is defined as "the spirit of the age" or "describing the intellectual
and cultural climate of an era."

Thanks for bringing this one up again though... definitely deserves it.

Yeah, thanks. I figured even if everyone here has seen this one, it is at least
worth mentioning and definitely worth conversation.

Well, really, either would be nice but I s'pose I could aquire the video on my
PC with a little searching, then could burn it to a DVD. I appreciate it though.
Hell, I still have to watch the whole thing. I have only watched through part 1.
