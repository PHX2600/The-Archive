## Defeating ISP extortion

My ISP, a monopoly named Y gnition, extorts a $1.50 per month from users who want paperless billing but refuse to give them control of their bank account for automatic payments. Sick of it, I entered a test card number and bogus information to activate automatic payments. I hoped for a failed payment, no more paper bill and $1.50 off my next balance. It worked.

[quote:18dq3mbe]As you are aware, Y gnition Networks bills in advance for service.
Unfortunately, during this month's billing your credit card was
declined and payment was not collected.[/quote:18dq3mbe]

And I paid my bill online as normal. Even better/worse is that I called to correct it and they stated that they couldn't due to billing system maintenance or upgrades or somesuch. Fine by me. It just shows their general greed and ineptitude. Examples of which include...

Naming critical systems after movie characters

With an expired cert

Allowing internal docs accessible to the net

And the biggest that they store customer passwords in clear text. I know because they MAILED MINE TO ME.

Edit: I should state the simple choice: $1.50 a month or control of your bank account.

Is this your only choice for ISP where you live?

Yep, hence monopoly. They specialize in multi-family residences and have profit sharing deals with management companies. Our condos are working on getting Cox. CL won't touch us.
