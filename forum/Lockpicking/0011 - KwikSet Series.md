## KwikSet Series
Posted by **Konshu** on Sun December 30th, 2007 06:41:27 PM

I figured id start the topic up on lock picking specifically targeting KwikSet locks. I myself have had practice on a few of these and have found them to be rather weak, however I am not sure if it was my luck with a worn lock or if their standard security line was indeed weak, focusing mainly on penetration of the lock assembly or busting the jam, instead of the actual picking of the lock. Anyone have any input or experience?

Kwikset is basically an entry level lock with sloppy tolerances. There are different grades of Kwikset locks that are not available to the general public. The commercial grade locks are more expensive but do have added security measures making them more resistant to by-pass techniques and picking. There are also a number of off -brands that use the KW1 key way such as Defiant locks. I can pin a lock that would be extremely difficult to pick, but as you stated the Dewalt Rotary pick can do the job in seconds. Most people look at physical security as 1 dimensional when in reality it needs to be looked at with a much broader scope. What good is $1000 door with $500 anti kick frame with a $200 Medeco, when there is a pretty little 1/8&quot; thick window to the side of the door that will allow access to the thumb turn.
