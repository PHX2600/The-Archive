## GitHub!

I finally... finally... did it and figured out how to make repos.  I don't know how many others are on GitHub, but let's make this a profile URL exchange thread.  I've made a few repos for some recentish &quot;projects&quot; to test the site out, seems pretty neato... I'll have to find out how hard it is to do a commit sometime.

Been on Github for a while.  You can find me at [url:iho51m1j]https&#58;//github&#46;com/PHLAK[/url:iho51m1j]. I'm probably the resident Git/Github expert in the house, so if you (or anyone else) have questions, hit me up.
