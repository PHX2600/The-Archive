## Predators got sick
Posted by **XlogicX** on Mon October 10th, 2011 10:34:45 PM

Some of our military drones and predators got a virus. My favorite part:

“We keep wiping it off, and it keeps coming back,” says a source familiar with
“the network infection, one of three that told Danger Room about the virus. We
“think it’s benign. But we just don’t know.”

Crap like that does not raise my confidence in our killing machines at all. If
there were a skynet, don't leave it to our government, Terminator would have
malware...or...maybe that's how skynet would start in the first place.

“We keep wiping it off, and it keeps coming back” :?

“We think it’s benign. But we just don’t know." :?

Oh man, why would anyone allow that to be said. Makes our tech people in the
military look pretty freaking bad. :lol:

It's possible the infection came from a soldier playing a little bit of Mafia
Wars:

In reality, this assumption is made because the virus is a keylogger that
typically targets/phishes the demographic of Zynga like games. So it's not
really a proof, just more of a likelihood that the soldier was playing some
facebook games unsafely.
