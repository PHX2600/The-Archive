## PHP Frameworks
Posted by **zeke** on Wed November 10th, 2010 10:11:24 AM

What PHP frameworks does everyone know? Does anyone recommend a good starter one to get the hang of frameworks? I noticed Cake and Zend seems to be the two most popular when organizations are hiring php developers.

I tried Cake a while ago but ran into too many esoteric errors when I was trying to get it up and running and ended up liking Ruby on Rails better, but from what I hear, Cake is nice when it works.

I work with [http&#58;//framework&#46;zend&#46;com/:1odbw9eq]Zend Framework[/url:1odbw9eq] on a daily basis at work.  This is a fantastic framework with lots of power, flexibility and extensibility.  Zend Framework is backed by the leading PHP company [url=http&#58;//www&#46;zend&#46;com/en/](Zend) and has a large community and long history to back itself up.  The initial learning curve is probably steeper than others, but there's nothing that we haven't been able to with this framework.

Another PHP framework I've heard a lot of good things about is [http&#58;//kohanaframework&#46;org/](Kohana).  This framework is designed to be lightweight, fast and secure.  While I've only fiddled with this one myself, it seems like it might be a better alternative than Zend Framework for the beginner to intermediate PHP developer.

While I've never used them myself, when it comes to CakePHP and CodeIgniter I've only heard bad things from high level developers.  I'd avoid them like that plague.

Also, if I recall correctly, you said you were just starting to learn PHP.  If that's not the case, disregard the following.  If you are in fact relatively new to PHP, I recommend starting out without a framework and learning the ins and outs of the language first.  Also, make sure to learn object oriented programming/PHP (OOP).  OOP will make your life as a developer 100 times easier and all big frameworks use OOP to some degree.  Also, OOP is pretty common among other programming languages making it easier to switch between them when necessary.

Lastly, I found by having a personal project I was interested in and wanted to create I was much more inclined to learn PHP.  If you're learning to make money or hack things, you're doing it wrong.  If you're learning it to create something you have a passion for, or maybe even just learning it for the knowledge of learning it, you'll learn it much faster/easier.  So have fun and good luck.

Thanks for the replies. 

@Phlak: I think I have a decent understanding of OOP with figuring out what I need a program to do, creating classes, figuring out which functions belong to which classes, and keeping them as simple as possible to reuse the code. I am taking an OOP design course this semester so I'll find out if I missed anything or not. I'm not doing any fun projects right now because I'm so busy between work and school but I think creating some facebook game apps would be a lot of fun at some point. I have a few ideas that vary a bit from the typical hp, energy, stamina mafia wars style games.
