CloudFlare brings the performance and security tools previously reserved for the Internet giants to the rest of the web.

What does that mean?  Can you be more specific? What &quot;performance and security tools&quot; are you talking about?  To my knowledge many of the internet giants use the same (FOSS) tools available to you and me, they just have the money to provide a robust infrastructure to back these tools.

From their website:

[quote:3c0h0byo]On average, a website on CloudFlare

- loads twice as fast
- uses 60% less bandwidth
- has 65% fewer requests
- is way more secure[/quote:3c0h0byo]

I guess that's what passes as a &quot;security metric&quot;
