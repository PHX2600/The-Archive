How was the poetry reading?

The poetry reading also included some dude with a guitar, and a full staff of grandmother/fatherly figures watching.  There was also a Massage therapist there and would work you for 1 min/$1.  It was fagtastic.

We also got the boot to the outside so as not to jeer the folks making asses of themselves.  It was great though, because you could tell when one guy jumped up with his acoustic guitar to sing - *everyone* went on smoke break.  I dragged a friend that I used to work with to the meeting and he'll probably be returning.  

As far as the learning goes: There was one cat with locks there.  evil1 taught me (or rather, tried to) SQL hacking for the price of a foo-foo coffee beverage.

General amusement had by all.
see ya next month. -Jack

Besides the smell of sewage, cold weather, and lopsided table. It was still cool and I would do it again.

Memorable moment from the meeting:

Hanging out picking some locks when a group of middle aged moms came out for a smoke break. They see us with the tools and locks all over the place and one comes up and (not exact quotes) goes:

"Oh! Are you guys cleaning those locks?"

...

*momentary pause as we look at each other and try to come up with something that will both make her go away AND not make us sound like thieves or something*

ME: "Yes. We're cleaning them."

*woman looks confused and walks away*


Lol.

LOL @ "cleaning locks"!!!

But seriously, why not tell them the truth, maybe one of them is a closet lock picker, heh.

It was me in 30 years actually, I had a dream where I got in a time machine to go back in time and melt the hearts of humanity with my guitar and to break free of the bonds of the perceived universe and its transitory nature and awaken to the awareness that consciousness is a large bowl of fruit salad and fat free cool whip.
