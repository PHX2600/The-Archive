## Something old, something new

Hey all, sorry I haven't been available to all of you in a while. Also, sorry for not coming for that xbox. Whoops! 
Found a &quot;new&quot; technology I might like and thought I'd mention it, it's a plug-in for chrome that supposedly sandboxes and runs native ml code (be it x86 or whatever), they call it NaCL and &quot;Salt&quot;. It seems really crazy, with all the virus scares and heaps of interpreted languages and flash plugins or java plugins and cgi and clouds and all that, but it's out there. Saw it on a web published article of infoworld and decided i'll start looking at it, primarily because it's comfortable. Jeez, virus scanners are gonna have to learn it, i guess. If you are interested, here is where it is at:

Cheers!
