## Start building your parts bin, for free
Posted by **LosT** on Tue February 5th, 2008 01:03:57 AM

One of the most overlooked aspects of project building is getting a good
enclosure for your circuit-

Just as ICs and components can be had for free by the ancient and mystical
incantation known as "samples", so too can product enclosures be had, gratis:

<http://www.pactecenclosures.com/free_sample.lfml>

Pactec is one of many companies that will gladly send you free products, if you
request samples.  Only do a few at a time (they get suspicious if you request
more than say 3 or 4 items at a time)-

Tips:

  * Order every few weeks (not day after day)

  * Order SIMILAR products in their line- this seems less suspicious; it's as if
    you are looking for a suitable solution for a product you are developing

  * Get a good 'business sounding' domain (and hence email) *OR* use a student
    email, indicating that your university is conducting research *or* get a
    good gmail account that could be a personal email used by a business person

  * Request catalogs, updates, and further info (hence the separate email as
    listed above, it will get spammed)- they are less suspicious if you are
    seeking 'information' as well as the free goods

Again, depending on how you accomplish this, you are NOT breaking the law.  You
are utilizing their system with information that they determine to validate you
worthy of their free samples.

Many companies have an automated system that sends the parts for free with no
human ever even looking at the order (keep the volume LOW)-

Would you like a nice tidy list of the places that send samples relatively
painlessly?  (Respond with interest, so I know if I should bother...)

Penguin has gone through microchip before, a few times, successfully.
