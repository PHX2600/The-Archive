## Articles &amp; Projects
Posted by **PHLAK** on Wed July 9th, 2008 08:38:20 PM

Okay, so it's been long enough, so I went ahead and put up links to the old project pages here: [url:2d1mxy8u]http&#58;//www&#46;phx2600&#46;org/articles-projects&#46;php[/url:2d1mxy8u].

Now, onto the good news:

Penguin and I were talking and we've come to a joint conclusion... this site needs more content.  And how were we going to deliver that content?  All of you!  Our plan right now is to implement a Wordpress blog on this site and give senior members (that's you guys that have been around a while), access to that blog as an author so you can post to it whenever you come up with a good project and/or project idea.  I'm not yet sure on all the details yet, but when I have em, I'll keep you all informed.

So, what I want to hear from you guys are ideas pertaining to this blog.  Anything from setup ideas to possible security risks/exploits.  Go!

Yeah I was thinking Wordpress would be a lot easier than making each project / article page manually. The blog feature could be left out (thats what these forums are for!) and we could just use the cool page creation / handling / organizing features. 

     Another cooool idea would be to use some kind of php include to tie the projects page to Instructables (NaK?), since Instructables already has a pretty sweet system for that kind of thing.

P.S. the new KDE 4 is pretty cool looking.

Yeah, they used to have &quot;page syndication&quot; but I dont know if it's still working, I guess I could email the staff and ask.

I don't get what you mean by tying in with Instructables.  Please elaborate.

Yeah I found some stuff on RSS feeds but I couldn't find a way to get the entire project.

You can get an RSS feed of new projects from:
<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.instructables.com/ex/y/process/rss.xml">http://www.instructables.com/ex/y/process/rss.xml</a><!-- m -->

You can get an RSS feed for any tag with:
<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.instructables.com/tag/LED/rss.xml">http://www.instructables.com/tag/LED/rss.xml</a><!-- m -->
(replace 'LED' with the tag of your choice)

You can get an RSS feed for a user with:
<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.instructables.com/ex/u/dan/rss.xml">http://www.instructables.com/ex/u/dan/rss.xml</a><!-- m -->
(replace 'dan' with the user of your choice)

Other areas of the site may be feedable as well - try appending 'rss.xml'

So that might not work.
