"Constellation" module from Timothy Robert Keal alias jargon's "Sententia
Surres" (Sentient Surreal) Open-Source Weapons System Framework

The following is a Venn diagram matching function that is unfathomably faster
than any of today's neural networking, is indeed from the mid to late 90s, and
is so efficient that it can adequately operate on an 8088.

Enhancements over other automated analysis systems:

  1. Exponentially lesser processing load required than any neural network.
  2. Provides exact measurements instead of probabilities.
  3. Ability for self-analysis of self-produced analysis.

As used in:

  1. F-117 Stealth Fighter
     1. Prevent itself from simply falling out of the sky.
  2. MQ-1 "Predator" Air to Land/Sea/Air Engagement and Reconnaissance Drone
     1. Autonomously make mission-critical decisions.
  3. Landwarrior Program
     1. Prioritize data transmissions and advise actions.
  4. Breathalyzers
     1. Detect alcohol and narcotic signatures.
  5. London Subway System
     1. Autonomously flag suspicious activity.
  6. Airport Checkpoints
     1. Detect explosives and contraband.
  7. Cruise Missiles
     1. Hug the contours of the Earth in-order to fly below radar.
  8. B-2 Stealth Bomber
     1. Weave around radar and radio towers.
  9. X-33 "Venture Star" Space Shuttle-Craft
     1. Avoid direct solar flare activity.
     2. Navigate gravitational transfer points.
     3. Maximize orbital efficiency based upon surface mapped G levels.

Please provide a description of the code's function as well as in-code
documentation or instructions ASAP. The code is concise and minimized, and
therefore obfuscated.

@jargon: you have until May 3rd 2010 to redeem this topic.
