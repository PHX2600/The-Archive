Sweet, the thread belongs to me now ;)

In keeping with the question originally posted, I throw a search into google
along the lines of "intitle:index.of" followed by the mp3 I'm looking for ;)

Bot or not, it was off-topic spam that was posted verbatim to about 200 phpbb
boards. Blatant as logic put it.

The <1 minute join to post time just made it seem more likely it was a bot. If
it was copy/pasted by hand to all those boards, does that make it somehow less
annoying/useless/off-topic/spammy?
