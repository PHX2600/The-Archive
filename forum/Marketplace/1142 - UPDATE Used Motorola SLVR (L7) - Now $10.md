Posted by **dxh** on Wed October 28th, 2009 03:13:37 PM

Hey guys,

I've had this phone from back before Cingular joined the Dark Side, but haven't
done anything with it since I replaced it wif my Blackberry.  Anyway, its a
Motorola SLVR (L7), which is a somewhat older phone, but has some iPhone-esque
features like being able to sync with iTunes on a Mac or PC, and some things an
iPhone can't do like run java apps and take microSD cards.  Charger included,
but it also charges via a standard USB cable.

Also, BLUE LED BACKLIT KEYPAD ZOMG!

Full specs here:

BUT WAIT, there's MOAR!

Order now and you'll also get a free Cingular leather case and Cingular
earphones/headset, wired and not wireless for maximum h4x0r security.  Pictured
below:

I'll bring this to the next meeting if anyone wants it.
