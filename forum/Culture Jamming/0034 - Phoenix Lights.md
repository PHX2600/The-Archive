Hey thanks, but if you could remove a link to the guest book and put up a link here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw8WovNeAB4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw8WovNeAB4</a><!-- m -->

That'd be great! Thanks!

Fun times, we must certainly do it again however next time there will be a few UPGRADES:

1) Radio Beacon For Tracking
2) More People / &quot;Publicity&quot; - maybe builtmore / other heavily traffiked area 
3) A Dark Night - not on a full moon, not on THE DARK KNIGHT aka Batman
4) Moar Balloons Maybe
