Posted by **jargon** on Fri September 4th, 2009 12:08:09 AM

Well, It passed the anniversary of the _'End Times Storm'_ ;) in Arizona where
the sun was completely blocked out for 24 hours and all that could be seen was a
solid sky from horizon to horizon of purple cloud to cloud lightning.

20080828220048 was an hour into it according to my logs.

Comments? Memory lane? Photos? Videos?

I wasn't able to video nor photograph it because my mom left her camera at work.

It's pretty cloudy and windy in flagstaff right now according to nak, maybe this
year is the TRUE end times?!
