Wow, I am so there!

EDIT: It appears that it's &quot;Free and open to the public&quot;. Which is cool but frightening that it will fill up. I wonder how early we should get there if it's starting at 7...

I plan on being there no later than 6pm, but will hopefully be there sooner.

Rendezvou point set?

Not knowing anything about Tempe Center For The Arts Theater, do we want to say something like &quot;let's meet on ground floor, stage right (House left), 6 rows back?

For those of you reading this before leaving for Diggnation:

My fiancée and I are the ones wearing Diggnation and EFF shirts, respectively. My hair is considerably less spikey this time 'round though... got it cut.

Feel free to bump into us and say hi. I'm bad with faces, and really bad with names. So I may not be able to pick out any of you guys. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->


For those of you reading this after returning from Diggnation:

Too bad we didn't meet up. But it sure was awesome, right? How about when Alex took off his pants and stuck Kevin's laptop down his underwear. Yea, that was awesome...
