Can anyone hook me up with one or both of these sets?

I have no idea if they are selling them or if they are door prizes but I will gladly pay for both sets and be in your debt.

I do actually happen to have an extra set, and you would be a reasonable person to get that set to, see you at the next meeting.

I will hook you up with a proper HPC pick set talk to me about it at the next meeting and lets see what will suit you best. These sets are great but they are more of a novelty collectors set. They get tiresome after a while and are not very comfortable for picking locks for long period of times.

Old post I know,  but I am a member of Toool, and have both that set, and the new one- Got them from Deviant in Norway.  I'll try to remember to bring the new sets to the meeting if I make it...
