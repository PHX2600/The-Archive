Posted by **TerrorDrone** on Wed October 20th, 2010 08:06:51 PM

I know some people have shown interest in rax's darc idea at meeting but we are having some trouble getting organized we were thinking of have online based meeting weds nights at 2030 but haven't set it in stone yet. Pretty much so far me and him have been discussing start up capital, membership requirements and beer. Rax came up with a good fund raising idea but with more minds on it we can make it even better. So if having our own spot and also getting together for small group projects is your thing this is the time to get on board and let your self be heard.

Sounds bad ass, and I am all for alcohol to people 21 and older, O'douls or caffeine for the minors.

What is DARC/DRAC exactly for us non-ers?

DARC	Deutscher Amateur Radio Club (German amateur radio club)
DARC	Data Radio Channel
DARC	Direct Access Radar Channel
DARC	Defense Acquisition Regulatory Council (US DoD)
DARC	Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines
DARC	Dallas Amateur Radio Club (Texas, USA)
DARC	Dominica Amateur Radio Club
DARC	Dyslexia Awareness and Resource Center
DARC	Delaware Aquaculture Resource Center
DARC	Days After Receipt of Comments (contracts)
DARC	Deformed Alkaline Rocks and Carbonatites
DARC	Drug anf Alcohol Rehabilitation Counselor
DARC	Data Analysis and Remote Control (Sprint)
DARC	Denver Adult Rider's Club
DARC	Defense Acquisition  &amp;  Reports Control
DARC	Data Acquisition  &amp;  Reduction Center

DRAC	Dell Remote Assistant Card (Dell Computer)
DRAC	Directions Regionales des Affaires Culturelles
DRAC	Dynamic Relay Authorization Control
DRAC	Dynamic Resource Allocation Control (3GPP)
DRAC	DEERS/Rapids Assistance Center
DRAC	Dealer Rent A Car
DRAC	Data Reduction and Analysis Center
DRAC	Direcção Regional de Ambiente do Centro (Portugal)
DRAC	Data Reduction and Analysis Cell
DRAC	Digital Ratio Adapter Circuit (ABS brake systems)

I think dues are essential in keeping things going but it also needs to be available to potential members to preview without any commitment. 

"we were thinking of having an online based meeting weds nights at 2030" I think that is a great idea to get new people to see what it is all about and maybe "Break the Ice" before an actual meet. 

I saw something mentioned about facebook in another thread,maybe more events put on youtube, facebook, myspace, might bring more people or at least let them know all of the badassery going on during a meet.

Digital Arizona Research Center (DARC) is (or will be) Arizona's second hacker space. 

With the idea in mind that "more is better" DARC is not a competitor to HeatSync Labs, rather it is an additional place for hackers to gather and work on projects of interest to them. Let's face it: "the Valley" is a bit spread out and hauling ass across it can be a pain.

Things are just in the formative stages at this point. You have the the opportunity to help shape the DARC.  As @terrordrone posted, we are going to have a weekly chat to get things rolling. Bring you ideas and join us online on Wednesday evenings at 8:30 PM (or 20:30 for you alternate time format fans).


The room for the chat will be posted on the web site:  [url=http://theDARC.org:tuzn5cf4]theDARC.org>.

I had a chat with Rax last night about DARC , and it is a really great idea. It has a lot of potential to be something really big and exciting. Since other people maybe looking at the forum for information I am curious what the other members who participate on the forum think about it? It seems like an amazing chance to bring the community together in a whole. I have done similar projects in the past for my guys in creating  centers, and places where they have a voice input and can directly influence the environment around them. they have mostly been gaming lounges with open WiFi, but in a few places they actually had a full bar incorporated. We have held all types of events from tournaments, sporting events, movie nights, etc. Every time no matter what state or country it has been in they have turned out amazing. It doesn't take very much to keep them running they sort of take off once they start. You guys probably already talked about a lot of this at the last meet but please share your ideas in the open so all can see the badassery that is brewing in AZ.
