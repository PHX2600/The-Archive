## Giving away my old soldering station.

It's an Elenco adjustable temperature soldering station (with the stand and all). It's not at all the best one out there, and it's missing a very important part; the brace that holds the tip in all of the way. Still usable though, I've used it on many projects like that with no problems. But I finally got annoyed with not being able to point the iron downwards too much and got myself a Weller.

It is adjustable from 5-40 Watts, not a lot, but all you need if you are doing any normal through hole stuff. I remember having to solder on ceramic and also do metal straps on other heat resistant materials (where I used to work). Over there, we used MetCal stations, those are the best, the models we had were about $1,000, man, the good ol' days.

Is the soldering station still up for grabs?

Dude, it was grabbed in less than 2 seconds after pulling it out, when I brought it to the meeting.
