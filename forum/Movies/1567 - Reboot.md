Hey,

Anyone want to do another &quot;Phx2600 Movie Night&quot;? The Kickstarter Movie &quot;Reboot&quot; just was released to backers of the project (of which I am). 

Movie's website:

I haven't actually watched it yet. But it looks sweet.

EDIT:
Yes, I actually have a copy of the movie in HD.

I got all excited, I thought it was some kind of reboot of the show reboot I used to watch as a kid.

Oh well.

This looks good too, I would totally be up for a movie night.

Ahh, &quot;Short Film&quot; might be more accurate. As it's only 40 minutes long. So maybe we would need another movie too, to fill time.

I'm interested.  Do we have a place where we can fit several of us that's quiet and we wont be disturbed?  The place should preferably be centrally located and have good seating too.  We'll need a projector (Rax?) or the place will need a large TV.  Anyone have any ideas?
