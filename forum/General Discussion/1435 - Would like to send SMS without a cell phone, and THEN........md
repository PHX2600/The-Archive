Be able to get a reply via email.  Pretty simple.  This can be done easily right?

Could probably check out one of these cell modules from sparkfun. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/categories/69">http://www.sparkfun.com/categories/69</a><!-- m -->

Thanks Phlak. So I have to "upgrade my account" to get all those options?  As is, I don't have any of those options.

So I tried that, and it asks for a forwarding phone number.  I don't want to give Google my phone number, so I tried a fake one.  But no, they want to verify it.  So this is just another phone number collection scam I take it?

Even though I canceled the upgrade now all of a sudden I have access to the interface you showed above. Can't find settings for "Voicemail Notifications" though.

Found it. Not sure this is working right though, as I don't have a forwarding number.

Says I'm CLIENT_ONLY now.   Ok, lol.

I need someone's number.  Any volunteers?

My interface seems to have expired. 

Oh my... never noticed this before... this works for what I'm trying to do: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.txt2day.com/">http://www.txt2day.com/</a><!-- m --> and Google voice, well, doesn't.

I don't understand how you don't trust Google but you trust this txt2day.com.  Your fear of Google but willingness to give your data to this site seems unwarranted.  I checked out txt2day's privacy policy and it doesn't seem any better or worse than Google's.  They say they collect anonymous information and may use some of it to better target advertisements... does this sound familiar?  Sorry if this sounds a bit douchey.

I don't trust any of these sites, but Google is a fishy creature indeed.  I'm not using <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.txt2day.com/">http://www.txt2day.com/</a><!-- m --> but once in awhile, and I have the option of not giving them my email address, and of not giving out my phone number.  It's a different story with Google voice.  It's already an established fact that Google scans your email.  They say it's for advertising, sure, but I think there's a quite a bit more going on here.   As far as the TOS... I laugh out loud at TOS.  TOS are just open ended legal language to do whatever they hell they want with you.  If you think they're respecting your privacy in someway, you're probably not reading the TOS as they _really_ intended.
