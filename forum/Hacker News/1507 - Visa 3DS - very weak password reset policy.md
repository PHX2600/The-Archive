## Visa 3DS - very weak password reset policy

The summarise. You need 4 things to reset the password, 3 of which are on the card itself, the 4th being date of birth (....super hard to find).

...So, you're holding a stolen credit card...where would I get their DOB? Well their full name is right on the card, next stop: Social Media
