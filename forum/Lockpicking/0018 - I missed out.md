## I missed out!

Whomever that person was who brought the clear practice lock, I still want to
try it out for practice.  I got too caught up in everything that was going on.

What?! Now we regret going to that wedding instead of the meeting. Next time he
can find a different best man!

It looks like I won't be able to make it to the Feb 1st meeting. :(

My class gets done at 10:00pm that night.  I can try to get done early and be
there earlier, but no guarantees.  So I may not be able to lock-pick. :(

Otherwise someone would have to wait until 10:30pm for me to be there.  I'm not
sure if that would work. :\

Bring it anyway, though.
