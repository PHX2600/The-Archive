Hey Zapperlink. We kinda got along, right? Welcome back, looking forward to reading you. I've come back too, to the board at least. I stopped because I was swamped busy and depressed about my sick grampa and most post quality and post count were unbalanced. My grampa passed away on the fourth of july last year but I'm okay with it now. I've got a lot more energy and focus now, and I'm alot more informed, I even keep up on current events now thanks to the rss reader bulit into thunderbird.

Cheers!

Hi there Zapperlink. I have a baby now. With zaphraud. He is 6 months. I heard you have a lock picking kid. That is neat. They should meet and play. He's neat. I don't know if I've met you but helloo there. I am the partner of zaph. Not a hacker. I just attend meetings and attempt to talk to people.
