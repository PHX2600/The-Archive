## Defcon 20 CTF Quals
Posted by **AltF4** on Thu April 19th, 2012 08:10:58 AM

It's that time of the year again! Defcon CTF Quals. This time, we're getting serious. We have some time to prepare, practice up, and give it our all. I'm determined to improve on our performance from previous years past. To that end, we're going to be teaming up with the PSSH! (Phoenix Secret Society of Hackers) I've talked with the PSSH and they have agreed to the partnering. (Exact member counts to come)

Some information:

**Why**: Quals is a game, and the purpose of it is to have fun. (It's a relaxed atmosphere. We're all friends!) Hackers are naturally competitive creatures, I think though. So naturally we are trying to play the game as best we can.

**What**: The Defcon CTF Quals is not like the actual CTF. It's a jeopardy style quiz board game with lots of hacking related categories that usually involve things like binary reverse engineering, exploitation, forensics, networking, cryptography, etc...

**When**: The actual competition will be happening from 5:00 PM Az time (if my math is correct) on Friday June 1st through 5:00 PM Sunday June 3rd. Which means that it will be kicking off right at the start of the June Phx2600 meeting!

There will also be at least one practice session at a time and place yet to be determined.

**Who**: You! One thing I want to really stress is that we need your help even if you don't think you're the 1337'est haxxorz on the block. You might just be surprised just how much an extra head can matter when trying to unravel a tough puzzle. 

**How do I play?**: Either post in this thread to let me know that you want to play for the team, or else email me. altf4{at}phx2600.org. I'll send you our team's hash so you can sign up officially on the Defcon website here. This isn't an "application", nobody will be rejected. I just want a clear list of who the team will be.

Strictly speaking, you don't need to register. But if you don't, then you won't be able to submit answers yourself and maybe not be able to see the questions. 

**Practice Sessions:** [u:17ak6hwx]First:[/u:17ak6hwx] 
Our first practice will be the PlaidCTF. Run by the Plaid Parliament of Pwning. Happening April 27, 2012 21:00 UTC.

It is in a quiz game style similar to the Defcon CTF Quals.

Go and register for that on their website. Our team name is:
Phx2600 + PSSH

Meeting for for the Plaid CTF will be at Lola's:
4700 North Central Avenue
Phoenix, AZ 85012-1719
(602) 265-5652

Friday, April 27th. 5:00pm

[u:17ak6hwx]Lessons Learned from years past[/u:17ak6hwx]:

- Previously, we have had great success and a lot of momentum the first night. We are all together at the meeting and focused. But then the next day and a half just go by with little activity. Also the communication barrier of working remotely over IRC was burdensome. We duplicated work and spent way too long typing out what could have been spoken.

So this year we need to have a meatspace meeting on both Friday (the normal 2600 meeting) but then also Saturday and possibly Sunday.

- Numbers. We simply need more members on the team. The teams that qualify often have around 20 active members or even more. While we might not get that number, we can certainly improve upon our numbers from years past. Which is why I'm trying to recruit you now!

So again, please email me or post in this thread and let me know that you want to play! Quals is always such a fun game and if we are able to perform well it becomes even more fun. Hope to hear from you!

If there's no requirement at the actual Defcon event, I'm in.

Excellent point. No, there is no requirement or need to do anything at the actual Defcon conference. Quals is just a thing that happens online before the conference itself.

I'm in for helping with the qualifications but will not be attending Defcon this year.  Please keep me in the loop.

Last year was a blast.

Sweet!

Okay, our first practice will be the PlaidCTF. Run by the Plaid Parliament of Pwning. Happening April 27, 2012 21:00 UTC.

Go and register for that on their website. Our team name is:
Phx2600 + PSSH

We'll find a place to meet up in person, too. That is pending.

When I go to register it's erroring with "Team profile with this Name already exists." and wont let me register without a team name. Are you sure we all need to register?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **AltF4** on Mon April 23rd, 2012 10:31:41 PM

I'm actually not sure of that. Kind of assumed that would be how it would work. But maybe they just want you to share one login?

For this weekend's Plaid CTF, we'll just meet at Lola's, since I've been unable to find a better place.

Lola's Cafe can be found here:
4700 North Central Avenue
Phoenix, AZ 85012-1719
(602) 265-5652

Friday, April 27th. Let's call it 5:00pm until closing time. 8:00pm I think. Which is a bit early, but oh well. We can resume our efforts online afterward and/or organize another meetup there if we want to do that.

Anyone and everyone can come! Please do!

I'll try to be there.  I'll have to find a sitter for the kid though and this is kinda short notice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Thu April 26th, 2012 09:37:57 PM

I'll be there.

Posted by **Urbal** on Fri April 27th, 2012 12:07:03 AM

Worst case, Phlak, can u just bring her?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **AltF4** on Sun April 29th, 2012 04:34:11 PM

Well done, team!

We got a total of 340 points, which made us tied for 83rd place. (There were 243 scoring teams) We'll do full writeups on the challenges we scored. 

We'll have another practice session sometime before DEFCON quals on June 1st. Details on that coming soon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **AltF4** on Thu May 3rd, 2012 08:19:02 AM

Our last practice session before Defcon Quals will be Saturday, May 19th at Lolas. 1:00Pm - 8:00Pm.

Instead of participating in a proper competition like last time, this meeting will focus on teaching and learning challenges. Mostly ones we know the answers to. We'll start out by explaining the answers to the PPP CTF we got. That will be a good startup. From there, we'll work on some challenges from:

- <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.wechall.net/challs">http://www.wechall.net/challs</a><!-- m -->
- The remaining PPP challenges
- Maybe some custom challenges made myself

As always, everyone is welcome and encouraged to come! You don't need to have participated with us before, and don't need to commit to any further work. Come and hang out with us to learn a whole lot and have fun hacking!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another good announcement!

For space to play the CTF in, we will be using the super-awesome HeatSync Labs Hackerspace in Mesa! That event will take place on Saturday, June 2nd at 1:00 pm until 10:00 pm. Please take the time to say hello to the folks there, and donate generously at your leisure. 

<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.heatsynclabs.org/events/">http://www.heatsynclabs.org/events/</a><!-- m -->

So just to clear up any confusion, there are THREE (3) remaining meetups for the CTF and its preparation.

1) Practice Session At Lola's. Saturday, May 19th at Lolas. 1:00Pm - 8:00Pm.
NOTE: At the last 2600 meeting, I may have accidentally said "next weekend". Which would have been incorrect. Sorry for any confusion about that. The practice meeting is in fact on the 19th. We'll have lots of tutorials and learning experiences for everyone there.

2) Defcon CTF Quals: Day 1. This coincides nicely with the normal June 1st Phx2600 meeting. So just come to the meeting like normal.

3) Defcon CTF Quals: Day 2. HeatSync Labs!! June 2nd, 1:00 pm.
EDIT: Oh, and I forgot one important detail. FREE PIZZA! I'll buy the group pizza when we're at HeatSync on June 2nd. It happens to be directly next to Queens Pizzeria. Really good pizza.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I noticed that pizza place, I'm usually just at heatsync way too late. I will try to make it to atleast a couple of these if I can

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **XlogicX** on Fri May 18th, 2012 11:13:17 PM

I'll be there tomorrow, but a little later than 1pm for sure. I usually wake up around 7pm, I will try to wake up earlier than that for this though, but 1pm, nope, lol

We're on irc at Freenode, channel #phx2600-ctf

Hey all! One of the CTF people from DC20 wants to set up some CTF infrastructure/events at HeatSync, and everyone's invited! 
(We'll probably forward the necessary ports so you can participate from home or at the lab).

Please post something in his thread so he can gauge interest and assemble a kickass Phoenix team for next year:
