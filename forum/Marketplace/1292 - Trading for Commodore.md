## Trading for Commodore
Posted by **RetroTech1541** on Mon September 13th, 2010 01:48:10 AM

Willing to trade off 1 1541 disk drive with optional power chord and fat-din
serial cable for pretty much any 8-bit Commodore gear, hoping for a breadbox c64
or vic20, would consider other stuff.

I've got an old broken commodore I yoink'd the SID out of it if you want it for
parts (keeping my working unit :geek:), also ran across a big bag of 256k DRAM
in 16 pin DIPs part# TMM41256P-12 at my friend's old parent's house, grabbed one
to get info on it and I really don't know what to do with it/them (yet) maybe
you would have a use retro? Or anyone else near the "bottom of the food chain"?
I'm not even sure I'm allowed to offer them up, but will find out iAi...

I gave away so much C64 stuff/books/games when I was up in flag to this dude
from Cottonwood, he was all smitten... super cute  :D :P

Also have a box of unused punch cards if anyone wants some memorabilia from the
digital papyrus age.

Do not want disk drive though, gave a couple of those away myself... rather have
something like this if I were gonna do anything now:
