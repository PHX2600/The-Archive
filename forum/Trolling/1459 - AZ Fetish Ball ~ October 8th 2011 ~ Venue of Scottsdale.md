So trolling through the.. trolling board...  I found someone posted about Combichrist back in 2010.  This really excited me,  and since I wanted to make my first post in here a good one: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.azfetishball.com/">http://www.azfetishball.com/</a><!-- m -->

October 8th 2011 at the venue of Scottsdale.  The day after the next meet up. <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->

The concert lineup is Technodrone [my band], VJ  Ginger Fish, and Angelspit.  

Show includes hook suspension and burlesque.  I'm looking forward to meeting a lot of you on the 7th, it would be awesome to party with you on the 8th.  

A lot of people I introduce to H&amp;H events freak out that its a fetish event because they don't know what to wear, etiquette, dress and costume ideas are all on the site, as well as tickets, info on the after party, vendors, etc.  And dare I say, a lot of my friends and I do have a geek fetish. &lt;3

Tickets are $20 presale, $25 at the door, and VIP is $50.  There is a VIP area upstairs with human sushi plates, private bar and rooms.  I've had a great time at every event I've attended.

Tempting, maybe I should make $20 and go... I do enjoy weirdness, but I wonder how much weird do I enjoy  <!-- s:?: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /><!-- s:?: -->

pfffft fetish doesn't always mean weird, that's subject to personal opinion  <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: -->

You are talking to an evangelist of subjective reality, so don't worry about that  <!-- s:twisted: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><!-- s:twisted: --> . I know I'm talking from my perspective <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> (as well as everyone else <!-- s:idea: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /><!-- s:idea: --> )
