Hey guys,

I'm selling my GP2X F-200.  Its lightly used, in great condition with few scratches and includes:

* The F-200 itself.
* Carrying case
* Stylus
* 4GB Micro SD card w/ SD card adapter preloaded with Genesis, NES, SNES, and other emulators and things that rhyme with NOMS. <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->
* USB SD card reader

Here's some pics comparing the size of the GP2X with a DS and iPod Touch (neither included in sale):

Its a great device to hack around with.  The olde school gaming community has ported games like Quake II and Descent II to the GP2X platform and there's a lot of codecs and things to make it a decent PMP.

I can bring it to the next HeatSync Labs meeting or PHX2600 meeting if make it this time.
