## Time Streamer 1.1
Posted by **Valveritas** on Sat March 1st, 2008 06:53:39 PM

I'm done.  This is the &quot;final&quot; version of Time Streamer.

[size=150:soeyiuqa][http&#58;//www&#46;4shared&#46;com/file/39468516/6d3b0983/TIMESTREAMER_11&#46;html](DOWNLOAD)[/size:soeyiuqa]


Here's a recap of what it is:

[quote:soeyiuqa]
Time Streamer may remind you of a BBS style door game from the late 80's, early 90's. Playing through the game takes about 1-2 hours.  The game is inspired around the story/myth of John Titor (a time traveler) who supposedly came to this world timeline to obtain an IBM 5100 for his world timeline in 2036.

Difficulty: hard 

Time Streamer features:

	- Fully Randomized Combat System with Random Enemy Encounters
	- Sound Effects
	- RPG style Level Gains (/w new skills each level; 6 skills total, 8 levels total)
	- ANSI style color graphics
	- Sci-Fi storyline with some humorous undertones
	- Selectable Weapons and &quot;Shrines&quot;
	- NPCs  (you can interact with/talk to)
	- Randomized powerup/drop system		
	- Overall, what I might call a fairly advanced &quot;text-based tactical engine&quot;
	
System Requirements:

(Windows XP) 

	Because the code utilizes functions specific to XP it likely won't work in 98 or WinMe.[/quote:soeyiuqa]

[quote:soeyiuqa]
This game was programmed entirely in Windows NT batch scripting.  The point 
of this gimmicky exercise was not to make a &quot;great game&quot; but to _make a game_ 
with a toolset that isn't designed for it.  As far as I know, there is no other
batch file games this elaborate and complex, much less a real game at all.  I tend to
think this is a major leap in batch file game programming, and a fun game!

And here's what has changed in this &quot;final&quot; version (if you care to read all that!):

[quote:soeyiuqa]
======================
CHANGES FROM 1.0 TO 1.1
======================

(Major Gameplay Changes)

- The CP/M-99 Android will sometimes rise again (a la Terminator) with just under
half of his lifepoints.   Experience for Android has been raised to 130.  New sound clip added. 

- Enemies now drop &quot;power-ups&quot; (such as ammo, health, and energy) when they die,  if your 
killing roll is 99 or above.   These items can increase your max temporarily if you are already 
maxed.  Keep in mind though,  Zombie Virus Antidotes and Android Restoration Kits
have to be used immediately to have any useful effect.  You do not &quot;carry&quot; them.   New sound 
clips added. Note: heatlh and energy power-ups are lost when you gain a level, so if you have 
excess energy and heatlh, and you're about to gain a level, a good tactic is to use it before you 
lose it. 

- Instant kills will now result in receiving extra EXP (it'll be half the enemies normal experience). 
You will also receive a drop for this feat - it's cumlative with the 99 or above drop.

- The spiked wall in sector 16 now has a pratical use, that could help survival.  Find out for yourself!  

- A salvaged Android will now attack first instead of after you.  This should make him more useful, 
as he'll also function as a shield.  

- Level 5 (Superior Marksmanship) has  been reduced in energy cost.

- The Zombie Virus will now &quot;spread&quot; during the latter part of the game.  The CP/M-99 Android and the 
Angry Mutant are immune to this virus however.  The spread is triggered by your rising kill count and 
whether or not you've had contact with a Time Zombie. 

- A new enemy has been added - the Suicidal Deviant.  His critical hits will wound himself as well as you.  
It is therefore possible that he could die without a successful hit from the player.  On death, the soul
of the Suicidal Deviant will steal 20 energy from the player.   New sound clip added.

- CP/M-99 Androids and Angry Mutants will now gain more lifepoints during the latter part of game - 
triggered by a rising kill count.  This respresents the CP/M-99 Android's model evolution and the 
Angry Mutant's regenerative powers.  Note: This also affects the CP/M-99 Android's &quot;rising again&quot; 
lifepoints.

- Every 5 combat rounds the player will now experience combat fatigue (i.e., -1 energy).

- Synergy bonus added to your roll when you're using an Android to reflect a 2 against 1 advantage 
in combat.  Also, your Android's roll has been increased.  Unlike 1.0, having an Android is 
truly worthwhile now.

- A new skill has been added - Android Repair.

- Some enemies now have a dialog path that results in receiving 25 EXP, and also a dialog path that 
will result in receiving +1 Energy.  The former will not reset, but the latter will reset on meeting 
that enemy again (but not if you run away from them).  If desperate, these options can sometimes 
turn the tide of a losing battle. Hence, if you can't run or do a physical attack without penalty. 

- A calculation for time played has been added to [V]iew stats. This was much harder to do than anticipated.

- A rating system has been added to score your peformance if you win.  Your score is determined by 
time played, number of wounds, and what level you've reached (the lower the better).  



(Minor Gameplay Changes)

- Experience for two of the computers found has been raised to 150.  This lowers difficulty
starting out.

- John Titor reaction added, when you choose to sleep.  

- Sound clip added for locked door in sector 15.

- 's on salvaged Android's name is now capitalized.  

- Formating for the  CP/M-99 Android text has been fixed for the &quot;stop resisting!&quot; text.   This text
has also been changed.

- The Time Zombie will now attack when he's insulted through dialogue.  

- Experience required for next level is now shown in [V]iew stats.  Also a small calculation glitch has been fixed.

- Last Kill Roll added to [V]iew stats.  Note: does not reflect salvaged Android roll, just yours.

- Sector 3 description text has been changed to be less vague. 

- Included checks and warning notices for various windows operating systems.

- Ammo calcuations and health routines in certain areas have been expanded and changed to be more precise.

- The default for the Martial Arts skill has been changed to OFF.

- ENEMYNAME and ENEMY LIFE POINTS are no longer blank when you [V]iew stats at start.

- One of the sound clips for your android's death has been removed for not being entirely suitable, and just unnecessary.

- A sound clip has been added for the Angry Mutant's special ability.  

- The [V]iew stats screen has been cosmetically improved.

- A registry check for computer's country has been removed. 

- Combat messages have been made clearer.

- When you [C]hange weapons the shotgun will only appear if you actually have it. This led to some confusion 
before.

- The Angry Mutant's lifepoints have been lowered by 1.

The time and effort you spent on this is evident!  Awesome job!

Thanks nak. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> I put a 110% into this, as I really wanted to make it final.  Hopefully I succeeded.

When I start my next major project it'll definitely be in a different language! <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

Good god.  This time around I decided to post about Time Streamer on a new forum that I don't usually visit, [http&#58;//www&#46;godlikeproductions&#46;com](Godlike).  About two seconds after I made a post about Time Streamer, it was removed and my IP was banned.  HOLY COW.  I was given an email address (<!-- e --><a href="mailto:bans@godlikeproductions.com">bans@godlikeproductions.com</a><!-- e -->)
so I wrote to it.  Here's how the conversation went (I'm -GO):

&gt; Godlike,
&gt;
&gt; I've never posted on your forum before but my IP is banned already.  When someone puts a url in in their post, do you ban them automatically?   :/
&gt;
&gt; -GO
&gt;
&gt; ===
&gt;
&gt; 72.XX.XX.XX for spam. The Time Streamer post was spam.
&gt;
&gt; ===
&gt;
&gt; It was about a game I wrote, inspired around the story/myth of John Titor the time traveler.  It's a freeware game.   How is that spam?
&gt;
&gt; -GO
&gt;
&gt; ===
&gt;
&gt; Advertising is not free on GLP.
&gt;
&gt; ===
&gt;
&gt; Uh, OK.    Of the handful of forums I've posted about this Godlike is the only forum that reacted this way.  Very bizzare.  Again, it's a freeware game so I don't profit from it.  Even if you were to follow the links in the README.txt and went to my site, you'd notice that is also non-profit.
&gt;
&gt; I have no idea why anyone want to use your forum with a draconian and paranoid policy like that.  &quot;Godlike&quot; is definitely the wrong name for your board.
&gt;
&gt;In addition to what I've already said, I would like to point that no where on your site does it indicate you have this kind of policy. 
&gt;
&gt;-GO 

I don't think I've ever seen a forum with a stick so far up their ass.  No response to that last one.

Well, their loss I guess. I'd actually [i:owll0g9l]love[/i:owll0g9l] it if people sent me video games they coded instead of spam messages ... or anyway so long as I could examine the source to make sure it wasn't viral or anything. ^_-.

Phun game, by the way!

Silly bastards banning you  <!-- s:cry: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very Sad" /><!-- s:cry: --> 

Interesting forum though, I posted some responses to the &quot;Moses was high on drugs!&quot; thread  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->

I'm not sure how interesting it is.  [http&#58;//www&#46;godlikeproductions&#46;com/forum1/message13772/pg1](They have a 1342 page &quot;OFFICIAL&quot; George Noory Sucks Thread).  Yawn.

I notice they have a disclaimer that says &quot;We do not discriminate against the mentally ill!&quot;.  I wonder, before they ban you, how do they tell?  Maybe they just discriminate against the mentally sane, and that's how it works.  I guess that would explain the heavy traffic.    <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: -->

I just got this and tried it for 3 hours. 

Awesome job! Seriously. It does feel like a BBS door, good simulation. It's pretty funny. It's difficult. I leveled up to 3 by wasting time maniacs and time cops and snatching that trash-80, but still cannot defeat either the mutant or the andriod. Pisses me off. I only had three hours to play, but I will defeat it and then write a nice review as a player (I already like it, it's like &quot;What if lord was hard), and maybe even a strategy guide. 

Thanks for the lovely free game.

As a coder, I can't tell too much, I haven't looked at the data files or anything yet for fear of spoilers. I'm thinking you used the windows console api rather than the old conio.h functions. It's pretty for 8-bit ascii graphics.

Heh, thanks. I may have under estimated the difficulty a tad.  It's definitely winnable though.  Though there are several approaches, the best strategy is mainly planning each move, as well as where you're going, and keeping track of your stats as you go.  You always have to be thinking of survival, because at no point are you really incapable of being hurt. 

I'd love to see a review btw.  For that matter, I'd love to hear if anyone beat it!   <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: -->

I've uploaded the latest radio clip of Oliver Williams discussing John Titor on Coast 2 Coast AM with George Noory on march 20 of this year.   I've removed the commercials. 


[http&#58;//www&#46;4shared&#46;com/file/69186415/b232648b/C2C2008_3_20_Oliver_Williams_on_John_Titor_No_commericals&#46;html](&gt;&gt; Listen or Download here &lt;&lt;)


Recap from C2C:
&quot;Historian for alleged time traveler John Titor, Oliver Williams reviewed the facts of the remarkable case, and related some of Titor's past predictions to recent news stories. Titor's story has been pieced together from posts he made on Internet discussion boards beginning in November 2000 and ending in March 2001. He claims to have traveled to 1975 from the year 2036 (a period recovering from the devastation of World War III)-- to find an IBM computer that was needed to fix something in his time.

Williams believes that we could be living in an alternate reality that was changed by Titor's visit in 1975. Specifically, he did something to stop Y2K from happening, said Williams. According to the timeline Titor shared, America entered a Civil War between 2005 and 2010, then became involved in a global war which culminated in a nuclear exchange in 2015. By 2036, the population had been reduced by one third, society is more agrarian and the US capitol is in Nebraska. The country is divided up into five main areas, with states having more control.

Williams noted that the upcoming [http&#58;//www&#46;dailymail&#46;co&#46;uk/pages/live/articles/news/news&#46;html?in_article_id=512733&amp;in_page_id=1770:1g6dcgac]research[/url:1g6dcgac] at CERN may lead to unexpected breakthroughs in time travel-- and that Titor had posted comments connecting experiments at CERN to the development of time travel. Williams has created several podcasts related to the Titor story, which can be viewed on [url=http&#58;//www&#46;youtube&#46;com/user/JohnTitorDotCom](You Tube).&quot;


The game of Time Streamer was of course inspired around this story.

I short game play video for Time Streamer may be upcoming at some point.
