## Iran Strikes Back

For those that haven't heard about this yet, some Iranians may have GPS spoofed
a US drone to peacefully land in Iranian territory. The US says this was just a
malfunction of the drone...and I say: sure, and Israel (read: the US) really
weren't behind stuxnet.

Nice, I'm glad someone is GPS spoofing with so much gear reliant on that data

Interesting, though don't the drone drivers have a camera on board from which
they'd be able to see they're not landing where they originally intended to
land?
