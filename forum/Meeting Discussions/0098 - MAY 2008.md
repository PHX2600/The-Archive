Just curious who is going to make it to this meeting? I hope I will have some new toys in by then to show off. If anyone is up for a lock picking competition, and if enough people want to compete. I can supply some decent prizes.

I'm going to bring a medieval high voltage toy to try out. I don't want to spoil the surprise ahead of time though.

I'd like to go over a 15 page advanced SQL injection paper I'm almost done with. Q/A etc. Last meeting some people asked that I do  a presentation. Nows my chance.

zaph  &amp;  I will probably be there. I like that place. The gelato I got last time was Lemon Cheesecake. And Sea Monkey doesn't think gelato is a word. Bitch.

Lockpicking competition sounds like a cool idea -- what sort(s) of lock would be used?
I plan on being at the next meeting, but will have to duck out early.

Looks like I'm not going to make it. Got business with the future in-laws.

I don't know for sure on what locks exactly will be used. I will bring the padlocks I have, along with a simple Rim cylinder Kwikset that you would find on a common deadbolt. I will bring my vacuum table vice as well, hopefully  it wont upset the owner or manager to much. I will bring some stuff and just re-pin the lock to make it more difficult. At most lock picking competitions all of the competitors bring in a lock and then everyone swaps locks for the best total time. If you have a lock bring it, and your picks. I will be bringing some of my new gear along for show and tell. If anyone needs a ride just PM me with your contact details, I am coming from the west.

It was cool for me. The lock picking comp didn't get under way due to my lack of planning. I need to plan my time a little better. I tried to explain and demonstrate the following, 

Schlage Primus,  
Schlage Everest, 
Mul-T-Lock 7 pin garrison locks, 
MTL Pin-in Pin, 
Marshall keys (did a quick demo on my car),  <!-- s:o --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /><!-- s:o --> 
Tibbe 6 cut decoder and Pick (demo on vice),  <!-- s:o --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /><!-- s:o --> 
VAG 2 Track Rake, 
Honda 4 Track rake, 
Medeco M3, 
Medeco Bi-Axil, 
Dimple lock picks/Rakes, 
American Lock Bypass,  <!-- s:o --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /><!-- s:o -->  
Master lock combo by-pass, <!-- s:o --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /><!-- s:o -->  
Schalge re-pin, impressoning  hand filed key ( well I tried to),  <!-- s:evil: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /><!-- s:evil: -->  
Tried to Demonstrate Air Wedge and door cavity tool (it was dark so, success was 0%)  <!-- s:cry: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very Sad" /><!-- s:cry: -->  
Specialty Picks that were hand made
Went over ABLOY/ Disk lock principles in short
Door Slim Jim by-pass tool,

I think it was time well spent if just 1 person  learned something new and vulnerabilities in physical security. If I helped safe guard any one's property due to vulnerabilities in the industry, than I feel like I did something worth while. Once you are in the mind set this is what will help the industry change to better the general public.
