I don't have a rework gun but I have had some pretty good success using a
toaster oven for re-flow.

You might look into it if you cant get your hands on a rework gun.

Hey TerrorDrone, any chance I could borrow that from you then, I think the fine
point would be completely not needed for this kind of thing.

I'll PM you my contact info

How do I get my daughters PS3 to connect to the internet? I have a modem with an
ethernet cable into my computer upstairs for internet access. But I just bought
my daughter a PS3 and apparantly you can connect to the internet with either an
ethernet cable or wireless access. Her PS3 is in the basement. Not near my
computer at all.

I will suggest you to search in your local region. Repairing it won’t cost a lot
and you have as good as new console again.
