## Meeting History
Posted by **XlogicX** on Mon July 28th, 2008 12:49:01 AM

I would like to put more focus back into this neglected part of the website. I will try to bring a notebook and a pen and try to take notes of some of the stuff we have talked about each time. If anybody else wants to do this as well (making up for conversations that I miss), feel free, and you can email me with what you have. Urls and other references would be welcome.

The stupid HOPE conference got me remembering the things that used to fire me up, I have been too apathetic to the scene for the last year or longer, it seems that I have quietly unplugged. I'll start my plugging back in with taking more ownership again, starting with keeping the site more up to date. I also think that PHLAK's wordpress idea with the articles and projects section is great. Some of the content is dated, and the effort it takes to keep it up to date is unreasonable compared to his solution.

See you all at the next meeting <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

Maybe we could work the meeting history into the WP blog as well.  I'll definitely be experimenting with this and a number of other ideas as soon as I get it up.

Let me know if you need anything regarding that.

Very cool, this isn't the last hope for reals now is it?
