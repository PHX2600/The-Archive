## DialData DTMF Silverbox Modem
Posted by **jargon** on Mon September 28th, 2009 02:57:23 AM

Description:
Here is DialData version 0x002. This work is created by &quot;Timothy Robert Keal alias jargon&quot; as coded using freeBASIC, and is released under the &quot;Gnu Public License 2.0&quot;.

To use:
Drag drop plain/text files onto the program icon in order to send bytes at roughly 8baud of DTMF dial tones using 2 DTMF tones per byte through the sound card output. This DialData DTMF Silverbox Modem release version does not yet SEND/RECV; it only SENDs.

To recompile:
1. Ensure your paths are correct and extract the install folder into the fbsound folder. (Ensure the root folder of the install results as a sub folder in the fbsound folder.)
2. Use freeBASIC to compile using the [b:v0ljck5u]-s gui -mt[/b:v0ljck5u] compiler options.

Yeah that is basically how it goes down until I get the RECV part working. <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: -->
