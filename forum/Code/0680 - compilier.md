It's funny you mention c/c++, I just started learning c a few days ago (already learned c++ at devry). I just basically got bored at work and got started. The free compiler I'm using is gcc (GNU C Compiler). Yeah, it's *nix, but I'm doing it on my XP machine at work. I am using Cygwin, pretty cool stuff, especially when you get the X Server going. I have it on my thumb drive.

I've been using MinGW (Minimalist GCC for Windows). I use Eclipse CDT as the IDE, the integrated debugger is pretty nice, almost as nice as Microsoft's Visual C++ Express 2008. Anyway, I saw an article on how to get this combo installed easily.

It's out of date, first  download and install the same packages of mingw from sourceforge that the post tells you too, you may need 7zip (should be first hit on google search for 7zip) to uncompress gzip'd tape archives. Then just download Eclipse CDT from the eclipse.org website, install it and you should be good to go.
