## DoS/DDoS via shopping cart
Posted by **XlogicX** on Sat December 17th, 2011 01:08:00 AM

The idea plays off of how most e-commerce sites handle their shopping cart on the back end, especially with their garbage collection routines. About all process stop on the site when doing garbage collection on the shopping cart db. So, if many people put/script 100,000 things into their cart and just leave it that way (or even empty it, it sounds like), it's a time-bomb waiting to go off when they take out the trash.
