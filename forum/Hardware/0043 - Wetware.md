I just got rid of technosafari.com (if someone else wants the domain, I have it
until the 5th if you want to bother transferring it)

Good definition? Bad? Wanna discuss it?

I like parts of both I would say that hacking is more like:

Exploring and stretching the capabilities of a system by performing experiments
and interpreting and testing interesting results. Like a scientist would with
new discoveries, inventors do with new inventions, and like psychologists do
with the human mind.

I think of myself as a bit of an amateur computer scientist. Pen-testing a
system is like the scientific method:

Hypothesis: this computer is Vulnerable

Test: nmap ip

Result: runs rpc on a windows system

New Hypothesis: this computer is Vulnerable to rpc exploit code

Test: run exploit and gain access

Result: Access gained

Conclusion: computer is vulnerable to rpc attack, and remote access may be
gained. Report to IT department and propose a fix.

An interesting result to the first test caused me to modify my first hypothesis,
and make a more specific hypothesis.

I like PHLAK's definition, which is tight.  Nak's goes into the process though.

Phlak, interesting definition, I liked "exploring details" and "stretching
capabilities", which can be applied to the mind and consciousness, heck even the
"most users" thing is funny when applied to the brain :)

But is the mind/brain a programmable system? John C. Lilly thought so, I am not
quite sure at the moment (because I am programmed to be not sure?!).

This implies pre-destiny of a sort.  He also wrote a book on programming
yourself... I haven't read any of his books yet, just some articles and facts.

Yeah, oz, I like the example for computers :)

What Lilly says about programs has much to do with why I think human AI can be
mimicked for most people, with the right set of programs.  However, I don't see
the brain as the source of programs/consciousness but more of a relay station
and filter for experiences in a physical world in which these programs are
temporarily confined.  And yes, it is definitely possible to reprogram yourself,
but when you undergo this you're actually programming outside of yourself,  from
a 'higher vantage point'.

Did you mean human intelligence instead of AI?  Unless of course you are calling
human intelligence artificial, which is an interesting point of view...
artificial to God/Creator? (or the observer at the 'higher vantage point')
:shock:

I've entertained the thought of the
[brain as a quantum computer](http://www.quantumbrain.org/) and found that
website that is entertaining the same idea. (even though I am not sure about a
lot of their terminology they use in the papers)

So, lets say the Mind is the higher consciousness that interacts with the brain,
and the brain is just the pre-processor (chipset) that feeds the Mind
(processor) with the (extra)sensory data? Did I restate your idea's there with
that analogy?

MAN I LOVE THIS STUFF :D

I see human intelligence and the AI that we'll conceivably be able to implement
at some point as the same.  IMO, human intelligence is not that complicated.  In
fact, to even simulate human AI, you shouldn't have "intelligence" exactly but
instead have various pursuits, and also some random and chaotic elements thrown
in. Perhaps one day there will be a master program for this, and all these
variables can be tweaked however you prefer, for whatever kind of person you
want.  And while I do think human intelligence can be mimicked in future AI, I'm
doubtful it can encompass all the elements that make some people human. But most
people should be simulated at some point; which will be great, because we can
replace most people! ;)

I just realized I'm using three terms that mean about the same thing for what
I'm saying: imitate, mimic, and simulate.

YES, that's the very much the same as what I'm saying.  I see the Mind part as
existing in a meta-reality next to our standard reality.  It's the reality we
still don't understand very well, but nonetheless exists.  For example, consider
dreams and out of body experiences.

I could just download all the girl's brains in the world, run a "ask them on a
date" script, then the ones that come back "True": Date assured! YES! So that's
why we are working so hard on making computers faster and AI better :)

Does the higher self have anything to fear? Destruction of the physical body?
Never finding true love? Or does fear originate in the chipset?

I like the quote "We are emotional beings, pretending to be rational", maybe
emotion is the higher self... happiness, love, fear, hate and when we drop the
chipset we BECOME emotion. I find there is a very fine line between true
laughter and true tears.

Just out of curiosity,  where do you guys think the 'gargoyle' concept fits in?
Augmentation vs. 'hacks'-  Steve Mann for example has practically redefined his
own existence with computer enhancements (heck, he even gets sick if the takes
off his rig his body has adapted to it so well)-

And for fun:

<http://www.humanupgrades.com/>

We had a guy applying for a job here the other day who has magnets embedded in
his fingers- so he can run his hands along a wall and determine where power
lines are (inductance)-  and it's too bad RFID isn't a better tech, because
embedding those is pretty simple as well...

The way I see it, emotion and all senses, as well as everything we think of as
higher intelligence exists outside of the brain.  When the brain is not part of
the circuit, or only loosely part of it, everything is enhanced.  So instead of
seeing from two eyes, you would see in 360 degrees and see much more of what we
usually don't see, like the entire spectrum.

The brain is only necessary for a dense physical experience IMO, and to
experience concentrated individuality.  When the brain dies, you die in this
world, but only because you need it for this 'dimension'.  This also applies to
the body which is merely a vehicle, and the brain the starter/ignition/etc (<-
sloppy car metaphor here).

Ok, maybe I lost some of you.  But I've spent a lot of time 'hacking' the
metaphysical in the last seven years and this is what I've taken to be generally
true regardless of whatever religious or atheistic bents you may have.

Very neat, I like your point of view! I am still trying to figure things out, at
the moment I find that everything is the made of the same ... stuff ...
**ideas**, sort of a spiritual monist view.  In my philosophy class at PVCC,
they push the theist view, which I found interesting.

LosT: What do you mean by the gargoyle concept? I haven't seen the cartoon, and
have a little knowledge of them as scary decorations ... I can't fit it in!

I read the article in make magazine a few issues back about the pierced glasses
and the magnets under the fingers, I'm still thinking about doing the glasses
thing... maybe when I move down to Tucson :geek: (its not that bad, the lenses
are held on by magnets!) I thought having a magnet on my fingertip could get
extremely annoying, but it might come in handy for getting that little screw
that fell down between the ram and video card...

I don't mean to break away from the philosophy...

But you could probably define hacking as making things do what they aren't
made/meant to do.

I got my definition from the Jargon File.  (I don't want to take credit where it
isn't deserved.)

Oh, from Eric Steven Raymond?  I was reading him a bit the other day.  I was
going to post these quotes:

> If you want to be a hacker, keep reading. If you want to be a cracker, go read
> the alt.2600 newsgroup and get ready to do five to ten in the slammer after
> finding out you aren't as smart as you think you are. And that's all I'm going
> to say about crackers.

And this one:

> Concealing your identity behind a handle is a juvenile and silly behavior
> characteristic of crackers, warez d00dz, and other lower life forms. Hackers
> don't do this; they're proud of what they do and want it associated with their
> real names. So if you have a handle, drop it. In the hacker culture it will
> only mark you as a loser.

I'm not sure what to say.  I'm sure there's useful things to glean from his
writings - like what you found - but the statements above are fairly ignorant.
