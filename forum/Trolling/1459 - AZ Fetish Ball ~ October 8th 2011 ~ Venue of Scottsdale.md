Posted by **tokiya** on Mon September 19th, 2011 03:20:45 AM

So trolling through the.. trolling board...  I found someone posted about
Combichrist back in 2010.  This really excited me,  and since I wanted to make
my first post in here a good one: <http://www.azfetishball.com/>

October 8th 2011 at the venue of Scottsdale.  The day after the next meet up. :D

The concert lineup is Technodrone [my band], VJ  Ginger Fish, and Angelspit.

Show includes hook suspension and burlesque.  I'm looking forward to meeting a
lot of you on the 7th, it would be awesome to party with you on the 8th.

A lot of people I introduce to H&H events freak out that its a fetish event
because they don't know what to wear, etiquette, dress and costume ideas are all
on the site, as well as tickets, info on the after party, vendors, etc.  And
dare I say, a lot of my friends and I do have a geek fetish. <3

Tickets are $20 presale, $25 at the door, and VIP is $50.  There is a VIP area
upstairs with human sushi plates, private bar and rooms.  I've had a great time
at every event I've attended.

Tempting, maybe I should make $20 and go... I do enjoy weirdness, but I wonder
how much weird do I enjoy :?:

You are talking to an evangelist of subjective reality, so don't worry about
that  :twisted: . I know I'm talking from my perspective :) (as well as everyone
else :idea:)
