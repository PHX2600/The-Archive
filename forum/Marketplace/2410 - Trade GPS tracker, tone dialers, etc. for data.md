## Trade GPS tracker, tone dialers, etc. for data

I have a GPS tracker with battery and magnetic Pelican case, straight off of a
car, for trade.

Also, RatShack 43-145 and 43-146 tone dialers NIB.

And an Alfa AWUS036H b/g adapter.

If you want to offer cash, that's fine. But as an experiment, and the
realization that few possessions actually have value, I will trade for legal
data. Unique is better. Let's see what you got.

GPS and tone dialers are gone.
