## Post-Defcon
Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Tue August 12th, 2008 01:07:05 AM

Defcon this year was pretty epic, some of the best presentations I saw were the ones on UE and Amateur radio.

As per usual there were a variety of odd happenings, I seem to remember some uncalled for fire alarms and a few out of the ordinary error messages...

Like this one on a &quot;target terror&quot; arcade game..

sorry about the bad quality, only so much you can ask from a cell phone.

and this one on a riviera players club station...

I also decided to spend 14 bucks to take the Technician level amateur radio test, I passed that and have some pretty good ideas for its use.

Your turn! what was your deacon experience like this year?

This was my first Defcon, and let me tell you that it won't be my last. I had an amazing time all around.

I had been told from several people that Defcon is what you make of it, in which case I wanted it to be as much of a learning experience as I could. So I caught a lot of lectures. Some of my favorites were the Hacking Kiosks and Billboards (those were entertaining) and also some of the Panels. (Meet the Feds) I definitely learned a lot from a technical standpoint, but most of all it really spurred my curiosity and enthusiasm for security.

I was there with my girlfriend and her brother and we got some good pictures from the 'con / Vegas in general, which we'll get uploaded whenever we can. My gf isn't as much of a technophile as I am, but she loves lockpicking and other stuff like that, so we hung out in the lockpicking skybox for a while. The skyboxes were a really good way to relax and chill for a while after being in a crowded (and often smelly) hallway all day. 

There was just so much to do at Defcon, and such little time. It felt like I couldn't get half of the things done as I would have liked to. You could have made a full day at just sitting and watching the hilarious t-shirts that everyone was wearing! Everyone there was really nice, too. I found myself striking up full conversations with complete strangers and being absolutely comfortable. 

Good times. 
(And pics to come... hopefully tonight)

Being my 4th year at Defcon (my 3rd really attending talks), I felt the talks given this year were better than the past 2 years.  My favorite talk was the one on Free Anonymous Internet Using Hacked Cable Modems (mostly because I use a hacked cable modem).

Anyway, I will be getting pics up ASAP, hopefully in the next couple of days.

this was my first defcon. we didnt go to many talks.

i met a guy in the elevator when i was a bit sauced and going to buy more wine and this was on sunday and he looks at me (i was wearing my badge in order to look cool) and says &quot;its almost over!&quot; in an upset way and i was like &quot;oh.. yeah... this is my first one.&quot; 

he says &quot;oh its your first time?! my name is lucky green!&quot; and i was all like lol and was like, &quot;oh i dont have a handle because i am a poser. my husband is a hacker but i am not. i am mostly an internet troll&quot; and he told me that was ok.

then i said that i didnt go to many presentations and he goes, &quot;well defcon isnt about the talks anyway. its about meeting with friends and partying&quot; and i said all excitedly, &quot;THEN I DID IT RIGHT!!!&quot; and he told me congratulations and left somewhere. 

we went to the BSODomizer thing and that was cool. mostly a bunch of people pointed to david and said &quot;hacker in training huh?&quot; and we would laugh.

Ok cool, I thought I recognized someone from high school at defcon! (I wont drop docs) I didn't know you personally, but I did see you guys around, just facial recognition... I was a measly freshmen when you were a senior.  Hope this isn't freaking you out at all, the clues needed to find out who you are lies in the picture URLs <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

Also the pictures aren't loading, I think we need your password <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

Really, Nak? That's pretty crazy. You must have a good memory to remember someone from that long ago. I sure wouldn't!

Pictures fixed. I was just being dumb with the URLs.

Hopefully I'll see you around at one of the meetings!

LOL!  Yeah, Nak pointed you out to me and was all &quot;Who the fuck is that guy, he went to our high school?!&quot;  Unfortunately I didn't recognize you... oh well!  See you at a meeting sometime (I'll try to get first Friday in September off).

Anyway, piktur tiem NOWZ!

This is $100 (cheaper than full price) ends in 9 HOURS and has no bids.
<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/DEFCON-16-Badge-w-SD-Card-and-All-Conference-Materials_W0QQitemZ110279530860QQcmdZViewItem?hash=item110279530860&amp;_trkparms=72%3A392%7C39%3A1%7C66%3A2%7C65%3A12%7C240%3A1318&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m14">http://cgi.ebay.com/DEFCON-16-Badge-w-S ... 286.c0.m14</a><!-- m -->

However, one for $60 has 6 bids or so, so apparently there is a real demand at some level.

I'd have jumped at the chance to sell you mine if it weren't for the fact that we got married at that hotel right then and I really want to save everything from the trip because of the wedding memories.

I'm thinking of listing mine on ebay, I checked completed listings... one went for 270 dollars  <!-- s:shock: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><!-- s:shock: -->

WOW, SERIOUSLY!  I may just have to sell mine and Sarah's.. and my last 3 years worth of badges!  For that kind of money, is it really worth keeping something like that?  Especially for you Nak... with your BLACK BADGE and all.  SHIT!  I don't know if I want to keep or sell mine now!  UGH!  Maybe I could just sell Sarah's... lol!  Don't think she'd care either.

Indeed, the one's with USB ports are being slung as &quot;RARE&quot;...  <!-- s:| --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><!-- s:| --> lol.

Yeah, if I sling mine for more than 200 bux then I would be making money by going to defcon this year  <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

LOL!  There was a party at the top of the Riv Saturday night, called the Freakshow.  Anyway, upon entering you'd get one free mix drink, and unlimited free beer.  Don't know exactly what was going on in that picture, just thought it was worth taking... at least that's what I thought a couple of drinks in.

Hey, if you're still looking to buy a badge, I've got two. I wanted to hold on to one of them, but I'll sell the other for sure. They're both unmodded, too. It might be easier than having to go through ebay, you know.

Hi Guys,

 Does anyone have the powerpoint slides from defcon 16's network stats...?  I'm working on a project at the moment comparing stats of various defcons.  The file is not available at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://earthquake.concernd.com/~lock/DC16Network.ppt">http://earthquake.concernd.com/~lock/DC16Network.ppt</a><!-- m --> and is the only one I am missing in order to complete my stats writeup.

Cheers,
Knightmare
