This shit is getting worse every day.  How long until the government realizes
it's provoking a revolution?

I had a discussion about this with an attorney friend. I definitely support what
he did from a civil rights and civil disobedience perspective and I do think
that they may very well have a slam dunk excessive force civil suit on their
hands. Though, it does turn out, the current case law does support the drug dog
indicating as probable cause for a search without a warrant - I don't agree with
it at all and what we see here is a confluence of practices that are each
contestable.

I realize the shaky ground that represents, what with drug dogs being imperfect
to begin with - even if they do actually smell drugs and indicate so, that
doesn't mean they're present - and the additional possibility of an officer
abusing that as a means for an unwarranted search - as probably happened here.
In fact the dissenting opinion of the SCOTUS case that established the drug dog
as a means of establishing probable cause included a mention along those lines.

Sadly, whatever charges they ultimately "arrested" him for will probably be
dropped which would prevent the possibility of this going up far enough to
overturn the status quo of case law for unwarranted use of a drug dog during an
otherwise innocuous stop at a constitutionally questionable domestic checkpoint,
miles from an international border.

The 100 mile "mere suspicion" rule was something introduced late last year that
the ACLU was fighting to resist while people were too busy drinking the Obama
kool-aid and thinking this would all be magically erased the minute "their guy"
got into office.  I don't think it ever really made the news; The only I way I
even knew about was because I was on the ACLU mailing list.  The legal term for
"mere suspicion" is ambiguous and I really hope this 100-mile rule issue goes
all the way to the supreme court and is banhammered as being atrociously
unconstitutional.
