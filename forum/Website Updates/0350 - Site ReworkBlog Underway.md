## Site Rework/Blog Underway
Posted by **PHLAK** on Fri August 22nd, 2008 09:28:26 PM

Ok, so I've got the basic structure of the Wordpress install taken care of, you can see that here: [url:1jdbs7ky]http&#58;//www&#46;phx2600&#46;org/blog[/url:1jdbs7ky].

This is going to work out great if all (or even most) goes according to plan).  I'm planing on replacing the static pages of this site with a Wordpress install.  By doing so it will allow any member with administrator privileges to easily edit any page.  Also, I will be giving anyone who desires it author privileges so they can write up projects or articles they've worked on.

The best part of this new system is the ability to put a post into a category and then have a link to all post from only that category.  For example, after a meeting Logic, myself, or any one else can write up a statement of what happened at the meeting, stick it in the category &quot;Meeting History&quot;, and it will show up on this link: [url:1jdbs7ky]http&#58;//www&#46;phx2600&#46;org/blog/archive/category/meeting-history[/url:1jdbs7ky].  I'm also planing on using this technique for the Articles &amp; Projects page.

The next mountain I have to conquer is porting the current website design to a Wordpress theme.  Now I've had limited success with this and will have to learn a lot in order to complete this, so if anyone has any experience putting Wordpress themes together, please let me know.

As usual, thanks for everyone's support, and if you have any comments or suggestions I'm all ears.

Well, at first I felt a little overwhelmed at the grandeur of this overhaul, but I've done some research and it's looking like there's plenty of information out there on porting sites to Wordpress themes.  Now I just need to find the time to get this going.

The following are a few links I found explaining how to convert or develop a Wordpress theme:

hey good job. every goon's domain i've seen tied to their wordpress blog lately has been a neverending redirect loop that never loads.  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->

sorry. it was my off topic way of trying to say that the blog you made, which is on wordpress, actually works. and that i've been to several personal websites recently that are just glorified wordpress blogs disguised as a domain, but the people have set them up wrong so that it's a constant loop of &quot;connecting to, waiting, waiting, connecting to, waiting, waiting&quot; that never loads. i guess most people are dumb at wordpress?

Nothing public is using Wordpress yet.  This forum is actually running PHPBB, and will be completely separate (albeit look the same) as the Wordpress install when I'm finished.

Just to clarify (and make sure I'm on the right page too); I think Taryn was trying to say that everyone else's websites that use wordpress suck and are implemented horribly, I don't think she was directly saying anything about our site (unless it was some insight on what not to do). I think PHLAK will probably handle this very well though.

Thanks for the clarification XlogicX, and the vote of confidence... I'm hard at work on the site conversion as I type this.

Got it mostly working, now to hammer out the kinks.

yes this. nothing to do with the site, hence using the phrase &quot;off topic.&quot;

ok continue!
