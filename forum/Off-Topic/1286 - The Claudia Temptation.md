## The Claudia Temptation

There is a door here, but it does not lead to anything I know; no familiar cutlery waiting for an owner to saute, like former years would burn into muscle memory, routine wakes up, gets out of bed and makes eggs. Not today. No medical dramas, sitcoms, there is something behind that door, but it is something new to me. It is something dangerous to me. 

When the door is opened I find nothing, I find nothing because what I find, I have never seen. Something like light but not exactly, I struggle to understand it as it struggles to understand me.

I do not overwhelm the space within the door, slowly fading out, extinguished by its substance(?). Illuminated. Something that is like light, or something that has me in its shadow; the door is closed. I have felt what is behind the door, but enduring it, I was not myself, consumed by the hidden creature. 

The monster withheld in the structure, I am safe again, unlit, I am an alley shoved into urban crevices, secure from him. 

I am still holding the handle. What is behind this handle is something I have never seen, behind this handle is something I can never know.
