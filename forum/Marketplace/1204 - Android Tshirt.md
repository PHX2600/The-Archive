So, is anyone interested in the following shirt:
([pic](http://droidshirts.com/shirts/images/touch.png)). I ordered a medium and
received a large. I've since been shipped out a medium, and the company told me
to keep the large.

So the shirt is
[$20](http://droidshirts.com/shirts/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=12_16&products_id=67)
(plus $9.95 shipping).  This large shirt can be yours for the low, low price of
$10.

I'll bring it to the meeting on 2/5/10 if anyone is interested.
