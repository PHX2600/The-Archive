I plan to give a presentation of a small part of what MedicineStorm and I are working on for a possible talk at HOPE (I've submitted to the cfp). I'm not going to actually release the tool I'm working on (just yet). For one, the tool is in progress, but I also don't want to break any of the rules of publishing something before the talk (it will be open-source as well, obviously). So I guess no video of the presentation either. He'll I'm not even going to mention what it's about. And with all this build up, the actual presentation should be fairly anti-climatic. 

...I know perl now though  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->

OHHH! A mysterious presentation on an even more mysterious subject matter! It's so mysterious I may or may not be there for this, it's a mystery (but I'll actually probably be there).

I think I'll give a little talk on nonsexual touch and how it can be used to increase compliance.

You help create a kid. I figure you'd have that part figured out by now.

So, I'm guessing the data projector would be useful at this meeting?

I may do a short talk on WordPress (in)security scanning, too.

Sure.. i could slide pres or freestyle, makes no difference. It does seem that talks and presentations are increasing, so it may be a good idea (assuming it's no trouble) to bring it every month.

Sorry everyone, I'm out for this month. I'm leaving Sunday morning and time got away from me. Sorry for the late notice, but I'll see y'all next month!
