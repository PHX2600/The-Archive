Apparently nobody i know has seen one of these either, so now i don't feel so out of the loop.

I know some low end motherboard and card manufacturers will buy used dies from the big boys in order to press out low cost copies which are prone to higher failure rates, but never heard of it being done for drives, i suspect that is what it is though
