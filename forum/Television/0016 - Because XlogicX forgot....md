... I have included Television as a form of media.

Hrmz, it's probably still too early to say for certain - but maybe it would be best to combine Television with Movies? Since things of interest seem to pop up with about the same frequency for both, and movies eventually make their way to TV anyway? Just my ¥200, of course. ^_-

I'll leave that up to XlogicX to decide.  If he so chooses, it will happen.  If not, things will remain as they are.

I actually left Television out intentionally. I don't mind it being in there though if we have stuff to talk about. I was letting my own opinion get in the way I guess; I consider Television to be a lower form of entertainment and media, but I guess this is enough of a reason for discussion. I will probably keep it seperate from movies. Though movies and TV share some qualities, they also have their differences too.

*grinz* Yarz, I don't watch tv at all, myself ... I have cable running to my haus - but the reciever has been gathering dust in a closet since I got it. ^_-.

It's all good, really; I was actually thinking after my first post that this would be a good place to put clips from local news and whatnot. (Although I'm not sure if it would be good to see PHX2600 crew on the news or not. O_o! )

You can't deny the good shows...

Simpsons, Futurama, The Tick, Get Smart, Married WIth Children, etc..

Damn good entertainment, imo <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->.. And they have a bunch on [url=http&#58;//www&#46;joost&#46;com:1rkvohmd]Joost[/url:1rkvohmd].

Yeah, good shows, but you can download them too, most of them anyway. I would have to say that commercials are one of the things I hate the most. This is not out of inconvenience like many people, my hatred for commercials comes from the hatred of attempts to manipulate for the worse.

I can't agree with you more... I rarely watch actual television anymore because the commercials are retarded and redundant.  Bittorrent/Tivo rox my sox!

Those are also available on DVD commercial free, and are therefore (in our opinion) movies.

Imho, yer crazy. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> They are TV shows. Just because you downloaded them or you got them compiled on a DVD doesn't change what they are.

P.S., @XlogicX, I think you missed my Joost link <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->.

We guess we consider it separate from TV because to us, TV is 30 min to 1 hour shows with commercials throughout. the DVD's/downloads are not those things. We concied you are correct, however, that the media format does not change the fact that they were originally TV shows. 

P.S. We're not sure putting a smiley face next to name-calling makes it legal, you two-faced crap-eating media-confused jabberwokky!  <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->

LOL, jabberwokky!  What an awesome poem.

[quote:32nsuh0y]`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

&quot;Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!&quot;

He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought --
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in thought.

And, as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.

&quot;And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
He chortled in his joy.

`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.[/quote:32nsuh0y]

Looks like I did, I didn't even notice it was a link at first glance. I figured it was some kind of 1337 speak that I was unable to fathom. I'll have to check the site out.

Hey hey, I simply used one adjective (hardly name-calling). And I ain't no jabbery wookie!

Why are you getting offended? We put a smiley-face after it!

I wasn't sure which one of you put the smiley face.

I'll say this in defense of TV...

If it wasn't for public TV, I would never have found out about Monty Python.


PS I'm talking circa 1989. There's no good reason to have a TV now.  <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: -->
