## February meeting
Posted by **JPerridew** on Fri January 23rd, 2009 09:39:01 AM

Gentlemen (And Ladies?),
It's time to look to the near-future and think about meeting...
Anyone planning on giving classes?  Last month was rather small, but I still had fun.  Then again it's the one day a month I get out of the house anymore.  <!-- s:mrgreen: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><!-- s:mrgreen: --> 
Remember, the more visibility that is given on here, the more likely someone will show up due to curiosity.
See ya there,

I will most likely be there with my usual locks, picks, etc.

I should be there, provided I don't get drunk or fall asleep.

Hit me up that day Logic.

Shouldn't this be in the Meeting Discussions forum?

K, moved it to meetings.

I'll be there, got the new jackknive southord set, has a new pick. I may toy around with some of ThatGuys locks if he doesn't mind.

BONUS: I found out the Minibosses will be playing at the Yucca Tap room that night at 9:15.  I intend to be there; If you saw the 'bosses at Defcon, you will like them just as much when you see them in Tempe, maybe.

I should be able to make it this week. Dunno what I can bring. I'll probably hang out and pick some locks. Play on my laptop, etc...

I ought to be able to make this meeting. I'll have my Google Phone (tm) there if anyone wants to check it out. I haven't had the nerve to root it and start playing with stuff on it just yet.

I'm also going to try to turn my Samsung NC10 into a Hackintosh. We'll see how that goes. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->


UPDATE: Hackintosh acheived. The native wireless card in the sammie isn't supported, but I'll swap it out as soon as I can get a deal on eBay. 

It was a pretty straight-forward process, too!

I'll be there. I'll bring some code projects I've been working on.

It totally sucks....I meant to show up, but this damn thing called sleep got to me (I work graves).  Anyone here smoke hookah?  I'd like to hook up with ppl here.  It's been way to many years since the last 2600 meeting.

Meeting was cool I am glad I went. A little smaller crowd than usually but a great vibe. I had the opportunity to teach todays youth a few tricks of the trade. Jargon had some interesting music from his band. I swear he is John Malkovich or one of his offspring. I got some great insight on the latest PDA phones out. Rax had some really interesting  stuff to show off. The light saber rocked!!!

Sorry, I didn't make it. <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( --> Fiance's sister just came back from Japan (she was there for 2 years). So that kind of trumped meeting time. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> Next one for sure!

<!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( -->, wasn't there this time. Ordered parts to get some i7 hardware into my box, got the parts the day of the meeting. Started putting it together and ran into troubles. I was really only about an hour away from getting it going when the meeting started, and I couldn't just leave the box hanging there like that. The reason I didn't come at all, the next step after installing OS, installing GTA4, so the next step from there was playing it... haven't stopped yet. I will make it to the next meeting though.
