Yes, things have changed.  I posted about it on Twitter, but I suppose not
everyone follows that.

The gist of it is I pushed a new home page and moved the blog to the Archive
section.  I've stripped the blog and forum of their custom themes because 1) I
plan on moving the forum to FluxBB in the future (when exactly to be determined)
and and 2) I was not keeping the themes up to date with updates to Wordpress and
PHPBB. This was causing some unwanted issues that were solved by reverting to
the default theme.  When I do eventually migrate the forum over I'll be adding
the header as seen on the front page to give a little consistency while
maintaining compatibility through updates.

If you have any comments or criticism feel free to leave them here.  I'm
listening.
