## Police Scanners
Posted by **ThatGuy** on Wed February 25th, 2009 09:38:55 PM

Does anyone have any info on a good police scanner to buy? From everything I have read so far they are completely legal. I don't know where to start, or what model to purchase. I know that I want a hand held version, but might consider a base unit. Any info would be great, and the cheaper the better <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

Hmm yes, this topic is relevant to my interests.

WELL YOU SEE, the thing is....

shits all digital now D:

typically 900MHZ Band Trunked,

so if you buy a cheap-o model that doesn't do digital trunking (10-200 bux) you are only gonna get like ambulance services and mall security

HOWEVER...

if you find one that does digital trunking (expensive) you can still get all the cool stuff police, fire, etc.

last digital trunking model I saw was radioshack brand pro-96 I think and it was liek 300-400 bux 

ANYWAY now you're informed, so don't buy what you don't want!  <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->
