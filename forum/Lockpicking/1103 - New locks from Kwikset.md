These locks are kind of interesting...

There's also something on [url=http&#58;//www&#46;engadget&#46;com/2009/09/12/kwikset-finally-adds-remote-locking-functionality-to-door-locks/:3safwfh9]Engadget[/url:3safwfh9]  about the [url=http&#58;//www&#46;kwikset&#46;com/accesscontrol/&quot;:3safwfh9]SmartCode[/url:3safwfh9] with &quot;HomeConnect&quot; to allow remote (hopefully encrypted) locking, etc.

I know this thread is nearly a year old but I didn't want to leave it open without a happy ending. This look can be defeated by every means possible with off the shelf tools and some very easily made home brew tools. I didnt have a lock to demo but I did show a video and my tools of how to defeat it to some interested physical security people at a couple meetings. It can be bypassed very easily, and can be forced open even easier via big a$$ screw driver. Some guy named Shane Lawson has even made a simple way to decode the lock [url:2tl0zrtn]http&#58;//vimeo&#46;com/4151972[/url:2tl0zrtn]. Once you have the key code someone can cut a fresh key to your lock and enter covertly. meaning no sign of forced entry and they can wait to enter when you are not home or on vacation. I have the bypass tool for this lock and have had them since the lock first entered the market. The part I never got around to doing is making a mockup door for the lock which I may still do in the near future. Mainly because I heard a uninformed Lowes employee praising this lock to a customer recently.

Good video by the way.

Sweet breakdown of the mechanism and decoding methods.

Well  you have some nice locks to play around with, they are still bump proof as far as I know. If you want to spend some coin check this place out for replacement locks[url:2fviwa5g]http&#58;//bayarealocks&#46;com/[/url:2fviwa5g] they use to carry Bi-Lock as well but I guess some recent developments changed that.
