So I'll be making it, one way or another with a lock and possibly a home brew bypass tool. I dunno if I'll bring anything else, maybe all those coupon cards.

Now... it's YOUR turn!

If I can get the day off, I am going to bring a bunch of padlocks, hopefully some new tools, maybe some high security bump keys, probably a new key to re-pin Xlogic's SC1 lock, maybe some related stuff. In total a whole bunch of maybe, hopefully, and probably. Oh and possibly a beer can. I suppose you will have to attend to find out. I will also have an open challenge to anyone who attends. If you can pick my chain of locks faster than me. I will offer you a prize from my collection.
