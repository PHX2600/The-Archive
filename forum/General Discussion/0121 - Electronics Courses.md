Anyone here know what community college in the valley offers a good intro course on electronics?

I've forgotten a ton of knowledge and I want to re-learn it.

I wouldn't go to Gateway CC, they will expel you if you make a [http://www.btard.org/LASTDAY/glowing_cock.jpg](mushroom shaped reading lamp) with your electronics knowledge. I didn't see any courses for electronics, that's why I had to take A+ certification II ... it's annoying when the teacher teaches LIES.

I actually don't know where someone would go to take a course on electronics basics  <!-- s:| --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><!-- s:| -->

Rio Salado has some courses every once in a while but they rarely fill to make a class. An alternative are the other 2 year schools like High Tech, ITT, and I am sure there are several others. I know in the High Tech class you get to make a FM radio and some other stuff. What is the A+ II is that the second part of the test which deals with hardware?

It used to be, but when I took it they just made the course take up 2 semesters or something, I don't quite remember.  Rax might know  <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->
