<http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-
intro.html> ...but I checked it out from the library, boy do I love flesh on
papyrus... Really. Good. Book, there are 3 sections: Pre-singularity - I've read
this part and I understood all his jargon dropping (not you Keal, although hello
ol' fren if you read this) Follows "venture altruist" Manfred Macx
making people rich and living off favor and him seeing the world change from
what it is to what it will be, this is where I got metacortex, great term.

Singularity - Follows his daughter, halfway through this part, harder read
because it's more legal jargon, and I'm not familiar... sci-fi = cool! law-fi =
wha...? OK time to wiki Scot's law, grr

Post " - haven't even started reading that part, it's the daughters offspring,
being born into a singular world

Confused by this singularity thing? I sure am! I think I was explaining
drunkenly to my mom last night, but its real serpentine and I can't really put
my words in the right order to pin it down.  But I eventually got to the point
of "Movies run at a frame rate, we are digital systems (DNA, base pairs) in
a digital system running at the same clock speed... so we have a camera that is
perfectly in sync with the frames of the movie, anything that appears smooth
(analog) is just that way because our cameras are in sync with the movie
PERFECTLY... we are simulations in a machine like that... tell me if I'm off the
mark completely, I still need to read the rest of the book, maybe someone else
has a better explanation of the situation... or wait sci-fictuation

Either way, bad ass first section of the book, 2nd section, still pretty
badass... too bad its still up in flagstarf :<
