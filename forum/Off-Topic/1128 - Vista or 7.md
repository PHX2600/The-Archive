Between Vista and Windows 7, I'd have to go with Ubuntu.

Now Ubuntu and 98SE... that's a tough call.

I've only used the release candidate for Windows 7, but even that seemed like a fast, stable OS.  My friend has the official release, and for a long time I kept stopping myself short of saying it was a good OS.  I kept looking for flaws or something that would make it a totally crappy OS, but I just couldn't find it.  After using the RC more and more, and seeing my friend using the official release, it's actually grown on me a little, and I'm waiting to get a copy from that friend (Ultimate 64-bit) and will be installing it as my primary desktop OS.  While it may not be everyone's favorite OS, anyone who says Windows 7 is crap is lying.  I'm honestly impressed with Windows 7, it's what Vista should have been from the very beginning.  Vista was like an extended beta of 7.  Like it or not, Windows 7 deserves respect.  Good job Micro$oft, you did something right for once.  NOW FIX INTERNET EXPLORER!!!

Note: I tested the Windows 7 RC (32-bit) on an old computer running a Pentium 4 (3.0GHz with hyper threading) and 1GB of DDR RAM and it ran very well.  Just thought you might like some actual specs.

I have personally run the RC several different versions on a variety of systems ranging from low spec netbooks to high end desktops and all have shown great marks and practically driver-less installs. I use Win7 64bit as my primary OS and have for quite some time. I have no complaints.

If Win98SE is the holy grail of OS, then why did it still crash so often?  

XP was way better.

I'm not sure what "RC" is... Root Canal?  Yeah, I guess I can see how Windows might invoke that association.

RC = Release Candidate.  It's kind of like beta, but a polished turd instead of just a turd.

Anyway, I recently obtained a copy of Windows 7 Professional (64-bit) and have installed it and am using it as my primary OS.  If I find any major problems or (less likely) amazing features, I'll post my finding here.

I bought a new PC with Windows 7 home premium.   It's been smooth sailing so far.  The way the start menu is laid out is kind of disorienting for me however, and seems to take me longer to find programs compared with XP.

I love the new start menu, it makes finding the program you want FASTER than XP (especially when you have lots of them).  Just use the search box at the bottom of the start menu to type the name of the program you want to run and it will pop up in the menu above.  If it's the top item, you don't even need to click, just press enter to run it.

On a side note, I've been running Windows 7 on my Desktop for close to two months now and don't have any regrets.  It runs great, has yet to crash or blue screen and has a lot of new little features I would not be able to live without now that I've used them.  Two thumbs up to Microsoft on this one.

I do like the search feature.  But I haven't acclimated to the rest of the start menu yet.  I seem to be the only one.  I probably need to look at a basic tutorial and then maybe I'll feel it.  <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

I had troubling with sharing the Windows 7 computer as well, but only because I didn't bother to read a couple of paragraphs on how to do it, but  tried to figure it out on my own.

Between Vista and 7, 7 is clearly the winner.  As has been said many times, 7 is what Vista shoulda been.
For me though, 7 is too close to Vista to make me want to move off XP, primarily for versatility and performance reasons.  With 5 years or so as the only "current" version of Windows, there are a lot of software and utilities that work with XP, and some of those don't work with Vista/7 because of the new redesigned kernel.

On the performance side of things, I REALLY don't care for all the built-in DRM/etc. in the Vista/7 kernel -- all those checks slow things down, and I don't like giving up THAT much control over my PC  &amp;  OS.  (Yeah, I know, I should switch to Linux...)  I ran across an article talking about performance comparisons between XP, Vista, and 7.
<http://www.computerworlduk.com/toolbox/in-depth/index.cfm?articleid=2026&amp;amp;amp;pn=2>
The last paragraph sums up pretty well why I'm sticking with XP for the foreseeable future:
[quote:irp8ro85]However, better scalability still isn't enough to offset Windows XP's huge performance edge on today's hardware. In fact, it won't be until after Windows 7 has been replaced by the next Windows that the fruit of Microsoft's multicore optimisation labours will be fully realised. Then, as we boot our 32- or 64-core netbooks, we can all smile as Microsoft's foresight and perseverance finally start to pay off.[/quote:irp8ro85]
