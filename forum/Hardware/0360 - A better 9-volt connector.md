## A better 9-volt connector

Well, better than this at least:

The thing I don't like about those connectors is the durability of them. Although they are cheap (usually less than $1), after I unplug them several times, they will start to bend funny, and then disconnect eventually (unless I am very careful each time).

Here is what I came up with:

It is just the top of a dead 9-volt battery. It's good for two reasons: It's cheap; after you use a 9-volt, instead of throwing it away, you have a free connector. The second reason is that it is more durable, the plastic on this end was very sturdy. The connector in the first picture way above has a cardboard surface. also, this connector has the through holes to easily solder something too. This is perfect.

Also, another neat goody is to remove 6 dead AAAA batteries.
