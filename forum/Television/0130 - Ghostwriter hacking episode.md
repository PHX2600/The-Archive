## Ghostwriter hacking episode!
Posted by **taryn** on Tue July 1st, 2008 07:21:37 PM

The first time I ever heard the term HACKER was in this episode. This is from 1993. The show was called Ghostwriter and it was on PBS. This was my favorite show as a little kid. I won't spoiler you guys as to who the HACKER is but you should watch it for the lulz factor anyway. Check out Julia Stiles as a .. what is that? A grungey computer geek I suppose. And they write sloooooooow. This episode is awesome. zaph's making fun of me for watching this now.

Ok here's the premise of the show: There's a group of kids and they have this weird little dude who writes words to them and they solve mysteries all around Brooklyn. Usually the episodes were split into 3-4 parts and were a half hour each, shown each Saturday morning.

WORD.

TOTALLY AWESOME!  I used to watch this show as a kid, in fact, I was just thinking about Ghostwriter a few days ago.

My two favorite parts were:
[list=1:dggo2y6h]
[*:dggo2y6h]when the teacher mentions &quot;disk's&quot; in the first episode and holds up a CD joking because CD's are used for music and, god forbid, storing digital media or viruses, and...[/*:m:dggo2y6h]
[*:dggo2y6h]when they showed an ACTUAL DIRECTORY LISTING!!!  This alone is one of the most accurate representations of computers/software in all media I've ever seen![/*:m:dggo2y6h][/list:o:dggo2y6h]

But yes... all in all, hilarious and entertaining!

Yeah iamghostwriter2 has uploaded a bunch of them. Yesterday after Max Mouse I watched &quot;What's Up With Alex?&quot; which is a &quot;rare episode&quot; because it was only shown a few times on PBS since it was a special drug episode and when Noggin started rerunning them, they never showed that one because O NOZ MARIJUANA! 

Anyway how are they able to type half a letter at a time while chatting with Max Mouse?! PHLAK I liked that disk/CD part too, ha. Then he holds up a mini disco ball and the kids laugh as if it were funny??? I also love how after they got kicked off the bulletin board they spent what looked like two hours trying to write something &quot;funky&quot; back to Max Mouse so that [s]he would accept them.
