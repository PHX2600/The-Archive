Hi y'all - this is my first time on this forum. I'm new to the hardware game and have a few projects I want to get started. I'm accumulating crazy-powerful SoCs and gadgets (Android) faster than I can deploy anything custom to 'em. !!! <!-- s:evil: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /><!-- s:evil: -->  So I figure this is a good crowd to hang with.

Anyhoo, my bike geek friends tipped me off to a SoC workshop at Avnet on the 1st (next Thursday). $50 gets you  an ARM Cortex SoC board (worth 100 bux) with adaptable IO ports, on-board Ethernet, munchies and maybe some useful training . I'm stoked.

I'm gonna try to make it out to the monthly meeting on the 2nd too, if anyone plans to be there.

edit: damn bbcode.
