Anyone interested in getting an autonomous bots challenge going?

Like the deacon bots from defcons past?

I was thinking air-soft / paintball turrets.

thought?

Yeah basically I competed in one of the Defcon bots competitions a while back and I want to try and improve on my design.

for example my last bot was pneumatic and used a sprayer nozzle like  <http://s.shld.net/is/image/Sears/9990000031850311> actuated by a servo as the main valve.

So I have been able to get a "for reals" solenoid valve since then and an air compressor instead of a foot pump etc etc.

So I was thinking its time for version 2.

Especially looking forward to not needing to create 100psi using a foot pump.

used open CV last time for the visual processing stuff, worked pretty good but I was always off because of the distance to the targets.

Its hard to get depth from a single eye. So this time I was thinking about using an array of cheap-o cameras instead of one pretty good one.

So if anyone's interested in building something like that or collaborating on a group build that would be cool.

I don't know anything about the engineering really, but was thoroughly impressed with your demonstration at Lola's and would love to tag along for the ride when you start the project if you have room for me <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

Absolutely,

Team-collaboration FTW.

also I was just looking into this little wonder which looks like it could be perfect for this kind of project.

<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://hackaday.com/2010/11/10/kinect-open-source-driver-demo-and-hacking/">http://hackaday.com/2010/11/10/kinect-o ... d-hacking/</a><!-- m -->

In the above post I was complaining about how hard it is to get distance measurements from a single cam.

With the kinect and the open source drivers we could have a fully functioning vision sensor with depth for less than 200 bucks. quite a steal.

Anyway, I'll try to post updates if/when the project moves forward.
