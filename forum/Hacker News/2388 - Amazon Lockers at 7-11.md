## Amazon Lockers at 7-11
Posted by **ArchAngel** on Wed September 26th, 2012 08:27:43 AM

Apparently the idea is that you can get things delivered to an Amazon Locker at a store (the article mentions pharmacies and 7-11 stores) instead of to your haus, if, for example, you don't want it sitting outside all day waiting to get stolen.

Here's a news article:

And, as always, the full text for archival purposes:

SAN DIEGO (NBC) -- If you are concerned about a valuable package sitting at your front door all day, how about having it delivered to your local 7-Eleven? 

That is the solution being offered by online retail giant Amazon. 

&quot;I think it is a brilliant idea,&quot; said San Diego State marketing professor Steven Osinski, &quot;Security is a big appeal.&quot; 

Amazon is setting up metal lockers in 24 hour locations like convenience and drug stores and markets. 

Tony Khwaha is a franchise owner of four 7-Eleven stores in San Diego and just added the Amazon Lockers. 

&quot;You don't have to wait at home all day long,&quot; said Khwaha, &quot;you don't have to be concerned what you are ordering might get stolen.&quot; 

A shopper can pick the 7-Eleven location during checkout when ordering an item. 

There is no extra charge for using the locker, but there is a size and weight limit of 10lbs. 

There are 42 lockers in Khwaha's store. 

In the middle of the lockers is a computer screen. 

To pick up your item you punch in the code number that you received in an email from Amazon. 

The door opens and you're able to pick up your item. 

Once it is delivered, you have a limit of three days to pick it up. 

Amazon won't say how many of these lockers are being used across the country but they have only been in Tony Khwaja's store for a month.

What's interesting is the interface where you just &quot;punch in a code&quot; -- surely that's connected to the internet ... and while the obvious &quot;hack&quot; here would be to use someone else's code to steal their stuff (not really in the hacker spirit, in my mind), I was thinking more along the lines of being able to invent a code so that you could stash something for later retrieval.

Any thoughts?
