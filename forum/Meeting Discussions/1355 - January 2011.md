The first meeting of the new year is usually a bit small, but we do it anyway.  Who's going to be around this time?

Friday the 7th?  I think I can probably make that.

I'll bring my new toy to show off maybe.

I'll be there with presents for all in the form of those phx 2600 stickers you'll find in our swag shop.

I'll be there for a little bit, although I have to be to work by 8pm that night, so that will suck. Owell.

Lola's closes at 8pm anyway, so not a huge loss.

I'll be there as well.

I won't have a &quot;presentation&quot; per se, but I'll have a (rough) outline of things (tasks, costs, ideas) for DARC.  I'm hoping that those interested in DARC will contribute their ideas, etc.

I should be there, and I'll bring that Adam Carolla book I promised M. Can't wait to see you guys since I missed last month.

Well, I forgot the book *doh*!

I can neither confirm or deny the presence of my body at said location at pre-determined time.

Update: Won't be making it, due to Failbook Hacker cup thingy.
