with all due respect grand administrator PHLAK, I implore you to back up such claims with more evidence than my history... seriously because I don't have anything to do with this. been playing TF2 the whole time.

Curious how the IPs match.   <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

Please explain what you mean?  I haven't noticed anything with a huge impact on this site, but I'm at work from 1pm-9pm, so I can't be monitoring it constantly.

If you can be more specific I can look into the problems and try and fix them.  If possible, also note the date and time so I can attempt to find any traces in the logs.

Or, who knows, the problem may not even be on my end and I'll have to call the hosting company and get up in their grill to find out what's wrong.
