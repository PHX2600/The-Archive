Posted by **nytebrew** on Wed June 3rd, 2009 10:28:02 AM

I found a site called shareapic.net which for gives free image hosting an $0.22
for 1000 image views. I thought, well, I at least want the image hosting and
then the thought came to try drawing cartoons because maybe some people who like
humor would click my cartoons (single frame comics). So I did a test one, so
everyone please give it a click. I know it's not very funny, and next time I
dusting off the page scanner and handdrawing and letting the cartoon.

Comic creation is not easy one. It is too tough to make each character and
recreating the same for the next frame.I was trying it for a long time and i
never succeeded. i payed lot to my stationary items, but like drawing very much.
I will try it till i succeed. i will try to click on yours dear friend. And it
is a good information also :)
