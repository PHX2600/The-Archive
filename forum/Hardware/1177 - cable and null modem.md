## cable and null modem
Posted by **ebastancy** on Mon December 21st, 2009 02:16:11 AM

How does one use a serial cable and null modem to transfer data between computers? I have an old laptop that does not have removable storage. Its an old 486 machine with no USB or ethernet/modem. I want to transfer data to/from it with my desktop PC. The notebook also has Win 3.11, and the DOS version is 6.2. How would I go about doing this?

I think you just need to cross the TX and RX wires and use some data transfer stuff in HyperTerminal...or that's at least one way to do it, I forget the details, but we did this as a lab when I went to devery. It really was just a matter of crossing the TX and RX though, as for as wiring goes.

Are you thinking of a crossover cable?  OP specified a serial cable, not sure if that still applies in that case.

nope, definitely talking about serial. We took normal serial cables, cut them, stripped them, and wired them through a bread board. Crossover network cables work from the same principle though; you need to cross the RX and TX.
