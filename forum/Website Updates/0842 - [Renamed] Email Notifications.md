BTW, to your knowledge, are email notifications working for the board?

I ask because this is the only board I'm on right now where notifications are
suddenly not working.

Your notification privileges have been revoked untill further notice.

That is all.

That's it, I quit.  Oh, and btw, I had sex with the copy machine!  (Oh man, I
shouldn't have mentioned that).

I lul'd.

Where is our high administrator in our time of need.

CultLeadr is in distress and his query's go unanswered

is there no justice, has the system failed?

I beg to whatever higher power will hear me that this will pass.

Email notifications should now be working properly.  There was a problem with
email system, got it all set up through good ol' SMTP now, so should be good
from here on out.  If there are any more problems, let me know.
