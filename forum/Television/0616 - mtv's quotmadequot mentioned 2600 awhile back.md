## mtv's &quot;made&quot; mentioned 2600 awhile back

i had this random memory. this had to be in 2005 or around there and i think i was watching mtv's &quot;made.&quot; and there was this nerdy guy who wanted to be made into a ladies man and he was showing off his uber nerd room and showed some 2600 magazines.

the only things i remember about the show:

1) he was a hardcore republican and met one or more of his dates at republican rallies at his school. he seemed to have an aversion to non-republican girls.
2) his made coach was some beefy dude who told him to wear tight t-shirts because he was scrawny and oversized t-shirts look dumb on scrawny nerd guys. (i don't think they do.) yeah he got a style makeover. i don't remember if he looked better before or after.
3) he went to a party and got made fun of because he started talking about like... well not stereotypical frat guy stuff. so some of the other guys at the party said to the camera, &quot;YEAH HE'S A DOUCHEBAG.&quot;

god i need to see if i can find a clip this on youtube somewhere.

yeah you're definitely right it seems like populations of frogs are dissapearing from some places and overpopulating others. but do you really think that has any impact on the modern music scene? i would have to argue that it doesn't, also your points about transcending nationalism to avoid closed society and war are sensational and I support them fully.
