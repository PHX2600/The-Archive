## The Infamous iPhone
Posted by **PHLAK** on Sat August 23rd, 2008 09:11:36 PM

Several people at my work have iPhones and they're making me want one sooo bad!  What does everyone here think of them?  I mean, I'd love to have 24/7 access to the internet without having access to a computer, but is it worth the price?  What major problems exist with the iPhones?  Is Jailbreaking them easy, and how much does this add to the phone?

Anyway, let me know what you think.

Well, I've not yet had to reformat my cellphone in order to get it to work, and I'm not eager to hasten the day this task becomes necessary.

LOL!  That's a good point.
