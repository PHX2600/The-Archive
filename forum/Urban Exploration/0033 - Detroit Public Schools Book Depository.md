Saw this on Boing Boing. Urban decay at its best.

Wow...that brings back memories.  I moved here from Detroit three years ago, and any time I see photos like this, it brings a tear to my eye, and I wish I could go back.  A few of those floors are absolutely amazing, as it's near impossible to find the actual floor with wall-to-wall carpeting of books, several feet deep.  The basement also has several feet of standing water that freezes in the winter, and with no wind or other means of the moving the water around, results in a near perfect skating rink.  My crew and I have had hockey games quite frequently down there <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D --> 

I've been to some other areas of the country, and while I'm partial to Detroit...being my hometown and all, I still say Michigan, especially the Detroit area, has some of the best UE opportunities in the country.
