## &quot;I play the electric triangle&quot;

Not exactly High Tech, but I've decided the triangle that gets so much mileage in the school band needed an upgrade.

I give you the Electric Pythagoraphone

I already had a plan to do the electric cowbell, I put it off as it will actually be an easier build.

That's 2 pick-ups from a trashed bass a friend gave me.

As for how it sounds... it sounds like a triangle would, though you can run it through an effects pedal and out an amp so there are a few more possibilities. Step Phaser sounds pretty awesome.

After the electric cowbell, I'm going to try an electric Rock Block.

That's pretty cool, you should bring it to the next meet.
