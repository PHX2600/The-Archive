It was called Compact Flash (CF-IDE). Funny!

If you are interested in USB internal expansions, check this vid, it is awesome.
Little USBs outrunning SATA.

Did't they start using this tech back in the day for allowing you to save your

we're just saying: don't forget to hold reset while turning the power off. :D
