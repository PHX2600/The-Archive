## Hi There
Posted by **maxwell** on Wed June 16th, 2010 12:12:13 AM

Anyone mind helping me with  class inheritance in python at an upcoming meeting? I am moving to Phoenix in a few weeks and am not sure what these meetings are like exactly. Hopefully it's a good place to collaborate on software development. I am not a hardware person, although I'm excited to learn about networking and learn about processor architectures. Any other procedural programmers out there (who hate OO but are forced to accept it's usefulness)?

Anyway this is getting way to long. Basically just saying hi and can't wait to go to a meeting!

(also, any other RHEL or Fedora Linux users on here?)
