*crickets*

I heard someone's going to be demo'ing a game?

I can teach you guys on Priming, if you so desire? Joe and Logic have heard it at PSSH so it might be redundant to them, but if they don't mind (and they think it's worthy) and the rest of you are interested, it's a fascinating topic.

"Demo" is a strong word. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> I don't want to get anyone's hopes unwarrantably high. What I do have is a moderately functional game server and client for matchmaking, along with initial 3D work for the eventual gameboard which currently does little else than move units around.

Though I'd love to show it off, if for no other reason than to give myself an arbitrary deadline to work at. No more than 10 minutes of "presentation".

I completely don't mind if you present priming again Urbal; I think everyone should find it interesting.

All of the above sound great! See you all Friday!

Yes, yes.  Will try to remember to throw this in my backpack when I get home from work today.
