The "telemarketers are gonna ravage your young, white, pretty cell phone" email
is _still_ going around. My wife had it sent to her last Wednesday and, knowing
the hoax, sent it to me to demonstrate the noobz she works with:

> Reminder..10 days from today, all cell phone numbers are being released to
> telemarketing companies and you will start to receive sales calls.
>
>...YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR THESE CALLS
>
>To prevent this, call the following number FROM YOUR CELL PHONE:  888-382-1222
>
> It is the National DO NOT CALL list.  It will only take a minute of your time,
> and it blocks your number for 5 yrs.  You must call from the number you want
> blocked and they will ask you for the phone #.
>
> Help others by passing this on to all your friends.

Love the caps.

From the [FTC](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt107.shtm):

> You may have received an email telling you that your cell phone is about to be
> assaulted by telemarketing calls as a result of a new cell phone number
> database; however, that is not the case. FCC regulations prohibit
> telemarketers from using automated dialers to call cell phone numbers.
> Automated dialers are standard in the industry, so most telemarketers don’t
> call consumers on their cell phones without their consent.

Next, is it just me, or does Chatterbug use a T-Mobile subscriber's number as an
example on their sign up page?

Some lady answered the first time I called and I got voice mail the second.

Thanks for posting. My g/w mentioned this to me. She got it from her supervisor.

Interesting, did you tell her that her phone number was the example on
chatterbug's site? :-)
