## Free Redhat... hat
Posted by **dxh** on Sun March 1st, 2009 09:59:09 PM

Red Redhat baseball cap I got from SCaLE.  One size fits all, composed of
cotton, red dye, and open source warm fuzzies.  I don't wear baseball caps, so I
have no use for it.

Price: Free as in free beer.  Will bring to March meeting.
