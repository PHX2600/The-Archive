I know the July meeting is usually pretty sparse due to the holiday, but who's planning on going?  I have to go to a dinner with my mom that night, but will try to show up afterwards if possible.

I'll be there as well. At least until someone else shows up. Then I'll leave, 'cause &quot;you noobs are ruining it for the rest of us&quot;.  <!-- s:mrgreen: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><!-- s:mrgreen: -->
