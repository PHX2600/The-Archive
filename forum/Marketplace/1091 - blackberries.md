Give ya $50 for one.  The wife needs a BlackBerry, we're on Verizon. What is the exact model number of that phone, I'd like to do a little research before finalizing this decision (thought it's unlikely I wont want it).

Sold one phone to phlak but verizon will not allow him to use a flashed phone so he is getting refund so 2 blackberry curves still avaible for sprint alltel cricket or boost mobile.

The phone is good, some small scratches across the top, but works perfectly.  Just stupid Verizon people don't know how to do their job.

This is unconfirmed but I am being told with the verizon alltel merger people with alltel phones will also have to buy new phones when alltel contract runs up. Like I said don't know if this is true just what some alltel customers are saying if anyone can confirm this or know that its wrong plz let me know.

I guess that means my 8330 is going to be outmoded by VZN.  Perfect excuse to get an N900 when they come out... I'm really hoping they go with Sprint...
