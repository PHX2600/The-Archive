## November
Posted by **AltF4** on Thu October 22nd, 2009 09:02:10 AM

Hey,

The first Friday of November is coming up soon. Would you guys like a talk on cryptography? I work a lot with crypto at school (grad student at ASU). I could go over a lot of topics that you might miss by trying to educate yourself on the matter. And I think cryptography is kind of a scary topic for a lot of people. Ever wonder exactly what you're doing when you're cracking a WEP network? Go over some of the history behind crypto, Information Theory, techniques in cryptanalysis, etc... Not too much math though. No prior PhD in math required. <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

Does this seem too... academic? It's not the usual format of "Here's a thing. Here's how to hack the thing." 

(Btw, I dropped the "Warrior" in my old name. I'm just AltF4 now. Avatar changed, too. But I'm still the same person. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->)

Sounds cool.

Thats cool, you doing work for a degree or research?

Im about to take the gre for my masters work thats why im interested.

Anyway crypto is always golden with me a lot of fun possibilities for a presentation.

It's for my thesis. Which I would love to talk about at the meeting, too! It's a cryprographic Wifi protocol. I'll show you the design and you guys can try to break it. <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) --> 

I could probably use some tips for how to implement it, too. I want to make an OpenWRT image with some code on it. But for actual libraries to make a link layer protocol? I dunno.

Yeah that sounds awesome lets do that

Cryptography has always interested me.  I'd love to hear your talk.

I too would love to see a crypto presentation.

I can bring a data projector. Does anyone have access to a screen?

This sounds like a great presentation.

BTW, this is "Geek Week in AZ"

Check out geekweek.com for all the fun techie things to do!

There is nothing at geekweek.com except a stupid domain placeholder.

I don't have a screen, but a projector for slides would be too awesome. I was actually just pondering the mechanics of how some of this would work if everyone has to stare at my laptop, lol. I'll to make everything super big and not rely on the slides in the first place. 


Oh, btw. I'm planning on bringing some codes to break to the meeting before the talk. Hopefully some things you haven't seen before. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> But I have a take-home midterm that I'm working on, so my prep-time on this sort of thing is being cut down.

This sounds exciting, I can't wait!

I have a roll of bright white seamless paper I bought to make screens. It's 52" wide so you could display about 7 feet diagonal for a 4:3 image. Might want to bring some dowels or PVC to hang it from. I work until 9pm so I won't be there but I could arrange a drop off at your place tomorrow after work.

Hmm. That might work. I'm not sure how we'd mount it (temporarily) there, however. Can we figure this as a Plan B?

Again, does anyone have access to a portable screen? <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

Okay, so it turns out that my printer is out of ink. So I'll just post the ciphers here instead of printouts. Just as well. Nothing too crazy here. I kind of ran short on time like I said. Nonetheless this should be fun for those who want to try them out. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

SPOILERS: All the answers are at the bottom, and colored white so it's harder to accidentally read them. (Does this BB not have spoiler tags?)

Note that the first bunch are so easy that I can't tell you the name of the cipher without pretty much giving it away! But if you want to see the names of the ciphers without the plaintexts, then just look next to the cipher number in the solution section below.

ALTF4,

your presentation was awesome, it definitely didn't disappoint.

Could you post your slides so I can get a second look? also if you had any other supplemental material you wanted to post or whatnot.

Thanks.

Posted by **AltF4** on Sat November 7th, 2009 03:19:11 PM

Thanks! Hopefully it was informative. 

Yea, I'll post my slides. I'll probably have it up by this evening or a little later.
