## Anime: Serial Experiments Lain
Posted by **nak** on Fri December 24th, 2010 05:57:53 AM

Eh eh? I've been re-watching this anime during my stay in P-town.  Very slow story progression, but very good.  It's like David Lynch made an anime really.  And the concepts thrown around in the anime are pretty sweet, Layer:09 is one of my favorite episodes just because they go through some &quot;really happened&quot; history: Ted Nelson, John C. Lilly, MJ-12 etc etc
This page has some neat stuff if you're intrigued:
