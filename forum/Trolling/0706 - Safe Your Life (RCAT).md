## Safe Your Life (RCAT)
Posted by **jargon** on Tue December 23rd, 2008 05:49:03 AM

A long while while I ended up banned from using the "PoliceOne" chat room
because the head guy asked me what I would do if I had a gun to my face. I told
him I would probably end up breaking their trigger finger either at the bone or
off completely and he thought I was just some douche bag that didn't know what
the hell I was talking about.

Finally, someone made a "YouTube" video about it, here let me link...

The method is called "RCAT" for a frontal attack with a pistol:

Here is another video the guy made for a hostage situation with a pistol:

DISCLAIMER: Do not practice RCAT for real on someone. Just like I said, their
trigger finger will either break at the bone or tear off completely. ..Even when
practicing, if their finger is in the trigger guard.

And remember, in real life, most likely you will not be able to move your hands
as fast as his without motor memory down pat.

Here is an example of a video made by people that don't know a damn thing they
are talking about for comparison. <http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1825645>
