Oh, yea. I read Little Brother a while back. It's really good. Once the semester is out, I want to read Makers.

Didn't think of posting here, but you guys recently had &quot;Little Brother&quot; as a play adaptation on stage in phoenix a few days ago!  If I were there I would've gone...

I'm about 5/6 of the way through reading &quot;For the Win&quot;, and it's really good. Would recommend, A+.
