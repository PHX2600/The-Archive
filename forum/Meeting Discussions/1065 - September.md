## September
Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Fri August 14th, 2009 12:44:22 PM

September meeting I have been asked to give a presentation regarding toner transfer pcb creation.

<!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://www.phx2600.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=1060">viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=1060</a><!-- l -->

I need to know how many people would be interested in this since I don't usually enjoy moving my printer more than a few feet. 

and if no one really cares ill skip it and not have to drag my printer to central Phx from east Mesa/Gilbert.

So speak up if you're interested!

Ill post some examples of my work later maybe for reference.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'd be interested in hearing more about board creation, and I'd love to see it done!

Didn't mean to step on your toes man.

Maybe you would like to give the presentation instead of me.

also I said I would post some of my work for reference:

<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~cbock/CrmDisplay/1.jpg">http://www.public.asu.edu/~cbock/CrmDisplay/1.jpg</a><!-- m -->

there is one small break on the right side at about the one and a quarter inch mark but besides that its pretty much perfect

the traces on that one are one hundredth of an inch (.01in) and the text is about half that (.006in aka SMALLLLLL).

<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~cbock/CrmDisplay/IMG_1347.jpg">http://www.public.asu.edu/~cbock/CrmDis ... G_1347.jpg</a><!-- m -->

here it is partially populated with components.

which cad software are you using penguin?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Mon August 17th, 2009 03:02:46 PM

Eagle or ExpressPCB depending on the situation.

I really like Eagle but sometimes for small custom projects Express is just faster.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **TerrorDrone** on Mon August 17th, 2009 09:44:45 PM

i use eagle and multisim never tried express pcb what makes its different from eagle

Not stepping on my toes at all, it just reminded me of my previous linkjob. I've yet to do it myself or see it in action so I'm all for a demo.

Not sure how fine a pitch the materials mentioned on that site allow for but the price is certainly right.

OK, anyone who's gonna be at the meeting should submit some black and white masks of images they want to see etched on to copper, since I don't want to bring my printer I will pre-print your submissions and bring them in ready to go for the meeting and demo. 

I only want to do two or three for demo purposes since each one takes about 15 minutes to etch so ill pick the ones I think best demonstrate the process or the ones that are most awesome.

these can be pictures or actual masks for traces, whatever you want as long as its a black and white image that's no more than like 3x3 inches.

the ones I pick ill let you keep after its etched if you want to keep it as a souvenir.

*Edit for clarification*

Any image format will work but if its a lossy format ( jpg, etc. ) that has blurry areas or edges that aren't crisp its probably gonna turn out shitty.

Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Wed August 26th, 2009 11:43:31 PM

well I could do one large sheet of those all at once

maybe like 9 of them on a 6in x 6in board

but I would be depressed if that's the best idea we get.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **t0rX** on Thu August 27th, 2009 01:50:17 AM

Peng.. we can just wear the pcbs as badges..

You could etch some BAM boards:

omggggg all that precious copper destroyed 

don't get me wrong bigclive is pretty awesome but id rather at least have something to show at the end of the meet.

Also I doubt the management would enjoy one of those going off in the corner.

I would like to 2nd the proposal of a mass (to a reasonable degree) amount of the phx2600 logo boards, and I want dibs on one (of course).

Having them as a badge sounds cool too, but I'm not so sure Penguin has the resources for something like that amount.

My stock comes in the form of 5.5 inch by 6 inch boards which cost about a dollar fifty each, I don't mind burning up one or two of them making like a bunch of little logos its just I'm a college student hobbyist so I only keep 2 or 3 on hand at any given time, making a whole badge sized thing at like 6x4 inches per badge would mean I'm out of copper after about 4 or 5 max and only a few people would end up getting one.

Looks like as of right now what ill end up doing is printing out maybe like 9-18 of those logo's across one or two 5.5x6 inch stock copper clad, so you would end up with logos etched in copper that are about 2x2 inches in size, meaning ill have to scale down Phlak's image significantly possibly killing some of the detail, ill do some test etches to make sure they come out OK at that size.

If you like we can do fewer boards at a larger size you just have to let me know before the meet so I can prepare the proper transfers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **TerrorDrone** on Fri August 28th, 2009 12:21:16 PM

I have no copper on hand but will help reimbruse pehgiun for using his

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Ugly** on Fri August 28th, 2009 04:20:54 PM

So instead of badges we get PHX2600 keychains

sweet

[quote=&quot;Ugly&quot;:1xc4teww]So instead of badges we get PHX2600 keychains[/quote:1xc4teww]

I'm down with a keychain-sized one.  Also, dibs on 2 (the wife and I) for the idea of using the logo!

Also, I'll buy you a drink (that's like a $3-$5 value) for the etches.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Fri August 28th, 2009 08:45:42 PM

I was thinking this could be way more awesome if we turn that logo into an actual breakout board for SOMETHING or at least some through holes like a perf-board.

Anyone else interested in that? or do we just want to keep it like it is?

Here's a pre-run of how its gonna look, the &quot;pittedness&quot; of the solid regions comes from an inherent flaw in toner transfer that is toner is basically porous at the microscopic level, also I failed to mirror the image D: Don't mind my gross fingers.

Posted by **Ugly** on Fri August 28th, 2009 09:37:22 PM

Beautiful, though I do have one suggestion. Since the logo is effectively round, you may consider rotating the picture 45 degrees so there is sufficient material over the top of the logo to put a hole in and actually make it a keychain when they're cut apart. Essentially creating a diamond shape when the logo is oriented upright.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Fri August 28th, 2009 09:49:44 PM

Delicious idea.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **XlogicX** on Sat August 29th, 2009 12:14:42 AM

Dude, that's awesome. I just realized something ironic too. The 'circuit' traces are actually the opposite of traces <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->. I like the idea of a functional break out board of some type, but I think we may be too close to the meeting now to do something really super cool. I could be wrong though. If we don't come up with something, I'm sure we could come up with a good idea at the meeting. Not only that, but after Penguin gives the presentation, more of us can help the mass production. With more planning and help, we could turn out more boards of the functional type. As long as it's not Arduino based, I'm beginning to hate that fad.

P.S.
If we get a picture of that board cropped and in the right lighting, it would make a great part of our website logo. Just the way it shines, in imply's that we are hackers under the sun.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Sat August 29th, 2009 02:50:43 PM

Ideas for breakout boards I could lay into the logo before the meeting:

Idea1:
USB to TTL/Serial FTDI chip for talking to your projects via usb

I have 4 ftdi chips and 5 mini-b surface mount usb sockets for anyone who actually wants to fill it out but i wouldnt be giving that stuff away for free.

Sparkfun Example:
<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8772">http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/produc ... ts_id=8772</a><!-- m -->

Idea 2:
Alternatively we could do a breakout for just teh usb socket for anyone whos already got usb enabled projects using pic18's or freescale chips or something
Sparkfun Example:
<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8401">http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/produc ... ts_id=8401</a><!-- m -->

Idea 3:
A series of through holes similar to the defcon badge this year that spell out phx2600.org or whatever I can fit, keep in mind though that these are single sided boards and I wouldn't be doing any drilling so if you wanted to use the holes you would have to drill them out yourself with an xacto or something. 

Idea 4:
a surface mount (ssop or soic) to DIP adapter for 8-16 pins

Example:
<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=498">http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/produc ... cts_id=498</a><!-- m -->

Idea 5:

You suggest something.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **TerrorDrone** on Sat August 29th, 2009 03:12:29 PM

ill try to do breaks out ideas 
wont be ready by meeting 
i just got new lab equipment yesterday that im itching to use 
love the idea of a badge with a function 
im sure we could all pull resources and possibly  doing something neato with this

Do want?

FTDI USB to serial breakout board logo.

only 3 surface mount components besides the ftdi chip and the mini-b socket.

I await your feedback

I hope so! In August Jason was sick, in July we had friends over, we actually attended in June but there weren't many people there. At the June meeting Jargon let David fuck around with his laptop. <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P -->

I knew that was the baby's handle. <!-- s:P --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><!-- s:P --> Also I scheduled Jason so that he would not have classes on Fridays. I was bummed we weren't there last month.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Automated Penguin** on Sun August 30th, 2009 07:50:36 PM

Well thats it then,

Unless there are any special requests Im gonna start printing the regular logo transfers for Friday.
Im gonna try for ~ 15-20 transfers, probably enough copper to do 12-15 for sure, that gives us extras in case of failed transfers.

Still time to submit custom stuff, but not much, so you better hurry up if you're gonna.

I didn't make the logo, I only printed it (the original that is).

And Ill bring a special one just for you with a lower case p.

I need you all to bring TUPPERWARE if you can spare it, just a small container will work maybe 3 inches square to 5 inches square,

I have like 20+ of these little things and only 2 pieces of tupperwear for etchant vats, so thats 2 every 15 minutes, so doing 20 would take a super long time unless you guys bring a few more containers for etchant.

Anyone who brings tupperware for etching can keep the etchant I put in it if they want, its reusable many many times but the tupperware probably wont be safe to eat from again.

Thanks!

*EDIT*

I think I have all the containers we will need, also in my haste to finish printing the toner transfer masks last night I failed to mirror the FTDI breakout toner masks so its original logo for everyone unless you want a backwards FTDI Breakout, yay!

Hey guys first post,

Just thought I would drop in and say hi =D

The September meet was my first one and I kind of just sat over there in the corner =P I had fun though.

I have a Broken Sega Saturn if any one wants me to bring it next time you guys could play with =D
