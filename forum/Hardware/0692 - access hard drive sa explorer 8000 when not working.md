## access hard drive sa explorer 8000 when not working?
Posted by **action.radio** on Tue December 9th, 2008 12:06:27 AM

I have standard Scientific Atlanta (SA) Explorer 8000. I've had for several years now. Earlier this week every channel was gray screen so I did a reboot like I've been told to do before, unplug power cord, wait 5-15 seconds, plug back in.

When I did, it said something like Fr.## where ## was some number and cycled up a bit, then it turned to h.### and cycled up a little past 800 till it would restart the number cycle again. At a certain point a dot would appear between the first and second number h.##*# and continue the cycle. Then another would dot would appear h.#*#*# continue the cycle. Then a period h.#.*#*# would appear below the second top dot continuing the cycle a couple more times when all dots and periods would disappear - h.### but continue cycle again. Every now and then it would freeze on a number like h.097 but then keep going up. Sometimes it would go back a couple numbers then back on up. And other times, the h would be a d - d.### but then back to h.### and cycle. Cable company says that meant the DVR was trying to find a signal. And I can't affect the numbers. Power button doesn't work, random keys don't work, access the system info doesn't work. Nothing but a paperweight that cycles through numbers.

Was talking with someone and they said like I had a bad hard drive with a corrupted disk [not exact words] and it is reaching a partition where the platter is screwed and cycling back over to try and get itself up but can't.

But the kicker is there are videos that I would love to get off because they are for someone close to me and I promised to get a copy to them of the videos. I've been reading for days, and tried to talk to Cox but no avail. Cox says nothing they can do except send tech to house. Tech said nothing they could do. I called SA and they said I would have to have company, Cox, do the calling because they don't have a consumer troubleshooting department, it is only for companies. Cox tech says they don't do that kind of thing. They just take DVR back, ship to SA with nothing, and give you a new one. So everyone is saying I'm boned.

But I am wondering if there is a way to attach it to a pc and get the files off the hard drive and saved for further use or something. I've read the encryption is nuts and can't be bypassed. I've read that it's saves videos in formats that there is nothing to decode them with. And others say you can't hook up to computer.

So, am I boned?

Only one way to find out, hook that drive up to your comp and start experimenting!

Nothing. Couldn't find a program to read files on drive. Also think a platter is bad. Hit a point and like the world stops. Ports don't work.

Got from inquiry:
&quot;...but unfortunately DVR boxes simply were not designed with data recovery in mind.  In situations such as this we will happily replace the failed box but the contents of the hard drive are obviously lost.&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately, they simply won’t do a data recovery for a DVR hard drive.  The issue is as much a technical issue as it is an issue of DRM.  When the hard drive is initialized for use in a DVR box software is written to the hard drive to ensure that the drive or the shows recorded on it cannot be removed and installed into somebody else’s DVR.  The other problem is that even if a data recovery were feasible there would be the problem of getting those recordings into another DVR box for viewing.  From Scientific Atlanta’s point of view the data on the drive is disposable and their obligation to us is simply to replace the defective component.&quot;

Interesting, well at least they are willing to replace the box.

You might keep the old hard drive and plop it into the new DVR just to see what happens.

Was there any readable data on the drive? 

you say the ports didn't work do you mean it wasn't recognized at all by the PC?

i wonder what kind of file system dvr's use...

cool anyway, thanks for the update!
