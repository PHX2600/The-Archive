My goodness, Phlak

You've really outdone yourself!

I really like this layout. It's keeps the good things from before and adds to it.

The word I'm looking for is "hyper-intuitive". A first timer to this board could just look at it and know where to go.

Well thank you very much... I can't express how good it feels to be complimented on all my hard work.  It's also great to see that this site is getting a lot of use/traffic... always a good thing.
