This just in from WikiLeaks:

Confirmation of what was widely suspected from US foreign policy with Sweden.
The US threatened Sweden with trade sanctions if they did not pass draconian
copyright and software patent laws they did not want. Also, the trial against
the Pirate Bay founders has been orchestrated by foreign US diplomats.

I, for one, do not want America to be engaged in this kind of underhanded
interventionist foreign policy. And if I were in Sweden, I would be very upset
that my elected officials backed down to a foreign power like they did.
