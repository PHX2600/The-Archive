It's funny how much company PR reps try to play things off. Saying that the hack
probably isn't credible and even if it were, it's ok because our passwords are
encrypted.

Even though actual accounts were posted to pastebin and the decryption was shown
to be way too easy for some of the accounts. PR fail. After the Stratfor paste,
it should be very painfully obvious that encrypting the passwords is not
everything.
