Someone showed me this software that is (at time of this writing) currently in public beta.

[url=http&#58;//themediamall&#46;com/:auiwb8h3]PlayOn[/url:auiwb8h3] will let you watch/stream videos/movies/tv shows from sites like Hulu, YouTube, and many more on your Xbox360, PS3, and other UPNP consoles/devices. Looks like they are promising support for the Wii soon as well.
