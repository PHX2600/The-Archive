## February meeting: 2/5/10
Posted by **Rax** on Sat January 9th, 2010 04:36:31 PM

Ideas?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **AltF4** on Sun January 10th, 2010 05:43:14 PM

I'd like to give a follow up presentation to my last crypto talk, if everyone would like that. 

It would be: Cryptography for Hackers 0x02: How to actually break stuff

The last talk was really fundamental and historical. Vigenere ciphers are cool and all, but it's not something you're going to see in a real security system. This time around I'll go into more practical systems and how they're broken.

Sounds great to me!  I rather enjoyed the last talk.

One of these days I'll get around to giving a talk on Git source control management... one of these days...

Think I may make this one going to bring some portable hardware hacking/maker stuff 
sorry no welder or drill press although wouldn't mind doing a welding presentation just can't figure out a good way to do it

Video tape it, then play it?

Sounds good to me, would love to see the practical application side of things.
Need any additional equipment (AP, add'l wireless card, etc.) on hand?

I would like to give a presentation on the basics of reverse engineering software.

I'm no expert on the subject myself but I Feel like I know enough to show off the basics pretty well.

If this meeting is already occupied with the crypto talk I could wait till next month, that would give me some planning time.

In my continuing quest to clean out my closet, would anyone be interested in a CRT 17&quot; beige Monitor? I plan to bring it to the meeting along with the &quot;screen&quot; for presentations.

Do it!  But probably for the March meeting.  One presentation usually takes up a good portion of the meeting, no need to cram if you don't have to.

Do we think we could hook up that awesome projector and screen setup again that we had last time? That was pretty epic, and a life saver for the slides, which would have been nigh-unreadable otherwise.

Contact Rax, he's the one that brings it, though I'm sure he'll bring it if requested.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **Rax** on Thu January 28th, 2010 06:05:05 PM

Yeah, I can bring the projector. The &quot;screen&quot; is supplied by Kilo (I think Phack has the backup screen).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **PHLAK** on Fri January 29th, 2010 08:31:03 AM

Who is Phack?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **twitterkilo** on Tue February 2nd, 2010 09:40:31 AM

And I should be there with my screen as well.

Phack is the evil alter-ego of Phlak. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

I'm going to bring my WPA tables to the meeting. Anybody that wants them should try and catch me early on, since they're 33.5 gb and take a long time to copy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **AltF4** on Thu February 4th, 2010 04:09:05 PM

I'd love to grab a copy. Though I may get caught up in the moment of the talk and forget. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> So try to remind me if you can.

Posted by **Rax** on Thu February 4th, 2010 09:48:57 PM

So, is the projector needed at the Feb meeting?

Yes, for the crypto presentation.

Thanks in advance good sir.

Posted by **saltthefries** on Thu February 4th, 2010 10:49:19 PM

I'll try and make an announcement before the speech so I can start copying files... it'll take about 30 minutes to copy.

I will be bringing my TI-92 Calculator and attempt to Overclock it from 10mhz to 20 =P

HA!  I remember when Penguin overclocked his TI-83+ when we were in high school.  Fun little hack (one of those, &quot;look what I did&quot; hacks), but doesn't provide much benefit that I remember.

I guess it speeds up Graphing and figuring out longer equations. Doesnt do to much else though. They suggest to add a switch to it though so I guess I will be adding that also so I can restore the clock speed to normal.

Only reason why I picked up this TI-92 was I lost my beloved TI-83+ &gt;.&lt;

I'll bring a 16-port 10/100 switch to make the copying easier, plus a couple extra Cat5 cables.

I'll be there, but im getting over a bad cold, so I dont think I will stay too long.

So after I got some on Friday night (not at the meeting) someone broke into my car and stole a bunch of stuff, including my laptop. <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( --> It was really quite unfortunate that this happened the ONE time I manage to accidentally forget my laptop in the car, too. 

I've already registered the serial # on it as stolen, but if anyone here sees the red Dell laptop in this picture:

then kick their ass for me.

My sympathies; I had more or less the same thing happen to me in Seattle last year.  Doesn't feel good man. <!-- s:( --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><!-- s:( -->

I'll keep an eye out for the laptop, but don't have much confidence that I'll spot it.

Posted by **AltF4** on Tue February 9th, 2010 12:45:20 PM

Lawl. I'd love to see the look on the theif's face when he opens my bag and turns on the computer. The bag says UNSC and look all military-like. (UNSC from Halo, of course) My lockpick was in there and a bunch of live boot cracking cd's.

Then when you turn on the laptop, I had set the grub splash screen to be the EFF NSA wiretapping symbol. But if you didn't know better, you'd just see a big NSA symbol in front of you with one of the menu options set to:

-= Self Destruct =- 

Lol, he probably thought he stole a secret agent's bag. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

I've always wanted to wire some thermite to the power switch on an empty laptop case and have some dick steal it and turn it on then burn I'd prolly go to jail for it though maybe do it with a tear gas bomb though

You know, on one hand it surprises me how spammers don't get caught more often. I mean, it's like not it's terribly difficult to find out who's paying for them. Just follow the links. It's pretty obvious that pharma companies have a lot of extra money for questionable ad campaigns.

Hi! I'm from Mexico, and I'm doing research on hacker culture. I was involved in the computer underground when I was younger, now I'm back as a researcher. I'm thinking on attending friday's meeting. Is that, ok?

You bet it's okay! But this thread is an old one from 2010. Let me make a new one for this year...

(How did we get 2 threads going for Feb meeting?)

Projector will be there.

Rosies for beer/food after Lola's closes (at 8:00 PM)?!?
