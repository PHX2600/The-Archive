## Facebook chrome://vidbar/content/downloader.js
Posted by **Valveritas** on Wed October 19th, 2011 03:29:23 PM

Anyone know why chrome&#058;//vidbar/content/downloader.js keeps trying to load whenever on Facebook?  I don't use chrome... is Firefox and Chrome merging?  In any case, I've noticed since the introduction of this script facebook is much slower, at least for me.  Maybe I have a FB virus or something.   <!-- s:? --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><!-- s:? -->

[quote:ou1iew5u]I had the same problem and found that once I removed the &quot;YouTube Downloader&quot; add-on I had previously installed on Firefox, that the problems stopped.[/quote:ou1iew5u]

Interesting, that may correlate to your previous YouTube experiments CultLeadr. It's nice when things start making sense...hopefully.

Him, thanks AA. I DO use that add-on... but I'd much rather use that add-on than facebook, so facebook will have to go.   <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: -->

Firefox has had [url=http&#58;//kb&#46;mozillazine&#46;org/Chrome_URLs:3rmkgq4b]chrome URLs[/url:3rmkgq4b] for XUL components since before the Google Chrome browser existed.  This likely has to do with one of your extensions.  A quick [url=http&#58;//www&#46;google&#46;com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=639a8625d5743e88&amp;hl=en:3rmkgq4b]Google search[/url:3rmkgq4b] indicates it may be related to the YouTube Downloader add-on.

Wait, I thought AA did this search already? Lol.

But I wasn't aware that Firefox has been using chrome urls all this time... but that's really not a surprise, is it?  Lol.
