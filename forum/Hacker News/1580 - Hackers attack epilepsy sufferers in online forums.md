Interesting...not a very technical thing to pull off. I don't think making an
animated .gif that flashes at 17hz really takes much hacking skillz. I also find
it odd that Wired says that there is "circumstantial evidence" that traces this
to Anonymous, I'm curious of the details.

I suspect anyone who doesn't make claim to their deeds could be associated with
the group known as anonymous

I wonder how many factions of anonymous exist?

I wonder if every person is their own faction...

How does anarchy work anyway?!

But seriously: it does sound like a 4chan/b/ thing to do >.< lol ... I remember
the attacks anon did on weird forums back 'n the day
