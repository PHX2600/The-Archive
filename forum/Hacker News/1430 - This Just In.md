Silly.

Simple attacks that can be performed by anyone who knows how to google search, copy-paste or use automated SQLi tools.  I'm suuuuuure there's a bunch of people who've hacked some really interesting stuff... but have kept the info to themselves or just notified the website owners of the attack vector.

This could also be mis-information.  How do you check these sorts of things?
Doesn't really matter, I think the Jester is a wanker and &quot;LulzSec&quot; is funny.  It's for the lulz, how could it NOT be funny?! (oh wait my email and password was leaked from pron.com  <!-- s:? --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><!-- s:? --> ) kidding... heh
