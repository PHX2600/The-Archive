I've used SD cards used with a USB adapter and have used it as a USB mass storage device.  So far I haven't noticed any performance lag from a regular USB drive, but then again I haven't really ran it against any benchmarks or anything...

SD cards in built in slots are great for encrypted hidden volumes which can be easily removed and destroyed at will. Speed in this case isn't critical.
