## Payphones
Posted by **jory** on Fri August 1st, 2008 11:16:25 PM

Hello, I'm new, my first meeting was 8/1 and it was great to meet and talk with a few of you.

I look forward to future meetings and learning more from everyone, in the meantime here are some numbers for payphones that accept incoming calls from my old stomping grounds (IA):

319-364-9863 - Laundromat, Cedar Rapids, Iowa
319-887-9852 - HyVee Gas Station, Iowa City, Iowa
319-447-9920 - Hyvee Gas Station, Marion, Iowa

They still work as of a few months ago, becoming fewer and farther between.

Hey there nice to see you on the boards, did you try that elevator yet?

I can't get that number to connect anymore so I have a friend back home checking into it, it may be history - which makes me so sad!
