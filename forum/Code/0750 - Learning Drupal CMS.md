## Learning Drupal CMS
Posted by **PHLAK** on Sun February 22nd, 2009 12:36:33 AM

So I've recently decided to start learning about Drupal.  Does anyone have any irreplaceable documentation, books, video tutorials or other resources that you can recommend?  With some wishful thinking, perhaps I'll update this site with Drupal in the future.  But for now, to the learning!

Wow I just learned what CMS stands for FINALLY.

Yeah drupal seems like 100 billion trillion times better than stupid wordpress.
