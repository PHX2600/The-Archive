## Metro Kulvers sign
Posted by **dual** on Fri February 11th, 2011 07:35:56 AM

The big LED display at the metro kulvers is accessible via anonymous FTP on the private wifi. The XML file that defines the messages is <flavor>.ooh, which is an O oh! Media file from adapt ive display s. Editing and uploading the file doesn't change the sign, so I'm guessing one either needs the software or script the sequence in ftp_diag. Called adapt ive once for the software though they didn't return my call. Have fun.

haha neato,  maybe it's simple as "rebooting" the system once the new file is uploaded?
