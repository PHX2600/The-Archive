## July 2012 (need a location)
Posted by **PHLAK** on Tue June 19th, 2012 01:09:55 PM

The July meeting is fast aproaching and Citizen Espresso will be closing early again (summer hours), so we need to agree upon a new meeting location.  In my opinion the only bad thing about Pink Spot was the small space and lack of big meating table.  The lady there seemed quite accepting of us and even suggested we "call in advance" next time we're coming so they can make sure to have enough staff on hand.  I wouldn't be opposed to meeting there again but if a bigger/better venue can be found would rather not meet at Pink Spot due to the size.

Anyway, please make suggestions on a meeting location for July (and possibly indefinitely). Also sound off if you've got anything cool to do/present at the meeting.

[size=150:37ncbj2a]UPDATE: Unless otherwise noted, the plan is to have the July meeting at [https://plus.google.com/102253522672025336085/about](Pink Spot) (same place as last month).[/size:37ncbj2a]

That was pretty much my only complaint of Pink Spot as well; it felt cramped. Otherwise, the place wasn't all that bad

Gangplank has made a deal with ASU downtown for the summer. See the article here:

<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://asunews.asu.edu/20120601_gangplank">https://asunews.asu.edu/20120601_gangplank</a><!-- m -->

I'll contact Gangplank and see if we can use their space for July  &amp;  August.

Very cool, I like the gangplank idea.

We might also be able to invade HSL again in mesa as long as we get the OK first.

Here's the reply from Gangplank re: ASU downtown:


[quote:2ivyiqo0]_Unfortunately the Cronkite space is only available to us from 8am-5pm each day. Otherwise, staff has to be on hand, as the building automatically locks down. Our Chandler or Avondale location could accommodate you, but if you'd like a Phoenix location, I'd check with UAT and/or Co+Hoots._[/quote:2ivyiqo0]

We've been down the UAT route before.

I've been checking out Co+Hoots site <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cohoots.com">http://www.cohoots.com</a><!-- m --> and it looks like they charge for their conference room ($25/hour) or $10 a day to work there. Their posted hours are 10A - 6P. 

They have a bunch of "events" there as well: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cohoots.com/events/">http://www.cohoots.com/events/</a><!-- m -->   

For example the Google Tech Users Group starts at 6PM and runs until 8PM.  

I'll contact Co+Hoots in the next day or two and see if we can do our events there.

Thoughts?

Downtown Mesa is quite a ways from downtown Phoenix. We'd likely loose the "ant trail" from Lola (Espresso) to Mesa. :/

But of course!  What was I thinking.

My vote is to do it at Pink Spot again for now.  It's not great, but in my opinion it's our best option at the moment.

I should invest in a small/portable projector screen (like the pulldown fabric or whatever). It may not be as big as a wall, but sure beats crowding around a small laptop monitor too. How much does something like that go for? (to lazy to google for stuff right now).

[quote="XlogicX":3uex6bks]I should invest in a small/portable projector screen... How much does something like that go for?[/quote:3uex6bks]

Purly speculation, but new... probaly $50-$100 (depending on quality/size).  If you're lucky you might be able to find one on Craigslist or at Goodwill for $20.

I went down to **Co+Hoots** and talked to the "manager" there.

CoHoots is a coworking space, but they have some events that meet there in the evening. It's a large area, and they're tech friendly.

The only "expense" we would have is the cost of someone being there to close up. They're going to get back to me on what that would be.  I'd suggest that everyone who shows up pitches in a couple of bucks to cover this cost. Since we won't have "coffee/pizza/gelato/etc" available for purchase (or the obligation to feel like we need to purchase something from the coffee shop that we're at) I think it'd would end up being about the same out of pocket. We'll find out for sure.

CoHoots  ([http://www.cohoots.com/](cohoots.com)) is located on 7th Street, 1/4 mile south of the I-10 freeway, and just a bit south of Roosevelt.  The address is 875 N 7th Street.

We might even get some more people at the meeting, if we get it listed as an event on their site. Who knows, perhaps some of our meeting attendees will like the "co-working" idea and start to use the facilities during the day.

Any thoughts/comments/concerns?

Talked with Rax, sounds like Co-Hoots want's $36/hr to use their space (that's >$100 for 3 hours).  Unless they decide to bring that price down substantially I don't think we will be meeting threre.

Due to this, I'm calling it now.  Unless otherwise notified, we will meet at [https://plus.google.com/102253522672025336085/about](Pink Spot) again.  Please spread the word.

I haven't heard back from CoHoots. It's probably worth the rate they're charging, but it would be cost-prohibitive for us.   <!-- s:cry: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very Sad" /><!-- s:cry: -->
