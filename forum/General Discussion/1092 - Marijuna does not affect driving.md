Nice, nak signed that petition, he told me there is this guy in flagstaff that has been collecting signatures for probably over a month.  That's a pretty funny occurrence though  <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: -->

what makes it even funnier was the fact that the driver told us she did the same exact thing 3 days earlier.

I liked the part when someone mentioned the tire being flat and she said, "No... it's not flat..." <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: --> It was flat.

Haha that's exactly what zaph said. He was going to lend a hand early on (we had to move the car) but when she started denying that her flatter than flatcat tire was not flat he decided to watch.
