So I like having a dual boot on my PC. The last time I did it I was messing with my ubuntu in Command line and I crashed my ubuntu gui. I had my Vista exactly the way I wanted and didn't want to nuke &amp; pave my machine again. I found [url:2ipls4ns]http&#58;//wubi-installer&#46;org/[/url:2ipls4ns] and gave it a shot. Well, it worked Great. I ran an Install inside of windows and then restarted my PC. When all was said and done I had an extra entry added to my Vista bootscreen. I nice little inviting 'Ubuntu' Selection. So, MAC has Bootcamp, Ubuntu has Wubi. I like it, Its much better then a VM setup or running a live disk as it detects my hardware and lets me run the drivers for advanced graphic effects. And for anyone that is interested and wants to check out a Linux distro, this is the way to go.

If you do want to do a regular dual boot without wubi, the way I pull this off on a PC is to install Windows first on the second partition and then install linux on the first partion ( I have only done this this with Ubuntu, Xubuntu and Kubuntu). When you are done you boot into Grub and windows is the bottom most selection.
