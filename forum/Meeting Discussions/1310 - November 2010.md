The November meeting is a few days away.  Who's going?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Posted by **zeke** on Tue November 2nd, 2010 11:04:51 AM

Actually I was wondering if I could join you guys this meeting. I've known about Phx2600 for a few months and have been meaning to introduce myself. I really wanted to watch Hackers at the Poly campus but missed it by a week! 

I am learning web development as a career and love working with computers. I've taken courses for php, mysql, xhtml/css, and a year or two back I took intro to c++ and intro to java which is what got me interested in programming. That's about as far as my programming knowledge goes so I don't have a lot to offer to the group at the moment, but I'd love to get to know everyone.   

Let me know what you think <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->

I may not be there this month. I'm trying to get tickets for "A Perfect Circle." <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->

Hi Zeke!  Welcome to the group, we're really informal, so I wouldn't worry about skill levels.  I do a lot of web app development professionally, but tend to be more on the C# and Ruby side of things.  I should hopefully be able to make it this Friday, and I'll be bringing stickers from [url=http://hayst.ac:2j9pgwtl]Hayst.ac> to give away.  <!-- s8-) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /><!-- s8-) -->

Wow I wish I could make this meeting but I am working nights now. I would love you show everyone how to open Penguins home in under 5 seconds, or just some other random stuff.

I heard recently that using a "blank" cut to all 3's would setup the lock to be torqued manually with no problems.

This saddens me deeply.

Absolutely!  Come on by.

I do web design/development for a living.  I'm skilled with (X)HTML/CSS and have a pretty good understanding of PHP and Javascript/jQuery.  I currently run and host this site on my own and would be willing to help you learn more about everything web when possible.

**REMINDER:** Meetings are now being held at Mama Java's Coffee House.  Info and address here: <http://www.phx2600.org/meeting-info/>

I thought Mama Java's closes early? Their hours still show they close at 6pm.

or you can just buy this tool <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF4wbyJ5uLk> it FUBAR's the lock, but works off the same principle as the shaved down key blank. This is destructive entry, might as well kick in the door for free or use a crowbar from harbor freights. Because this tool goes for a cool ~$90. There are other way cooler ways to open it where the lock can still be used, re-keyed, and the user/owner would never know what happened. I guess this is like the equivalent to "script kiddies" in some other specialties. Destructive entry is just not NINJA.

Welcome Zeke! Think of the meeting as a party at someones house, a bunch of small groups of people chatting, not necessarily structured presentations and what not. Feel free to just pull up a chair to any group and participate. I'll be the one ranting about Prop 203 not passing.

I'm on twitter as imkilo

Did Mama Java's change their hours? We had trouble with them not being open as the meeting was getting started a couple of months back.

If you show up to Mama Java's and it's closed and no sign of anyone hanging out in front, we may have moved to "Hava Java" which is just up 1 mile North on 36th ST then a half mile west on Camelback. It's a combo Coffee Shop/Gelato.

Hava Java was the "backup location" we moved to when Mama Java's was closed last time.

Address: 3166 East Camelback Road, Phoenix, AZ

Yup... this is true.  Meetings moved to Lola Coffee.  See [url=http://www.phx2600.org/meeting-info/:rlseg4d7]Meeting Info page for address.>

Hava Java had no room for us so we're going to meet at Lola Coffee.  See [url=http://www.phx2600.org/meeting-info/:rlseg4d7]Meeting Info page for address.>

MOAR LIKE LOL-A-COFFEE AMIRITE? 

I might pack up my graduate work and attempt a demo then.

I'll bring my own wireless router this time If I do.

That will ensure it works.

Thanks for the warm welcome everyone. I'm pumped about meeting everyone tonight. 

Too bad Unlimited Coffee closed, I lived within walking distance! Lola Coffee isn't far at all, however <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->
