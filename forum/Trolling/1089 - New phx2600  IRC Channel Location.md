Right now Kilo, t0rX, RetroTech1541, and jargon are the only chatters here!

Reason I switched the chatroom to freenode from 2600net, is on 2600net a lot of douchebaggery goes on, plus there are two splinter groups, #phx2600 on EFnet and #az2600 on 2600net, that are pretty much simply squatting the channels and aren't affiliated with our group in any way what-so-ever.

Q. &quot;Why PHX2600?&quot;
A. &quot;PHX&quot; is the Sky Harbor International airport code. Airport codes are globally unique and permanent and cover the entire metropolitan area, all suburbs, and all fringe towns.

Hope to see people pour into the channel, all are welcome, just be sure to leave your ego at the door and try not to be a blatant jerk. <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) --> I am the founder of the channel and am prolly the most fair site/channel/etc operator you will ever come across.

Toodles! Hope to see you stop by soon! Don't forget to put the channel on auto-join!

It is still there, I just tell people to go to this new chat.freenode.net one instead since 2600net gives everyone the heebie-jeebies and results in nobody using it.

There is a lot of scams, illegal activity, malicious activity, intrusion attempts, flooding, spam, and simple rotten eggs in general on 2600net.

Reason I decided to stop having the channel on 2600net is because people on 2600net were dropping social security numbers of meet-up members and calling members' bosses at work, etc.

If you feel safe with 2600net or whatever you refer to, feel free to keep using it. Just keep in mind the #phx2600 channel there just says to come to the freenode one.

Freenode is most likely the best IRC will get, due to the deep dedication freenode staff puts into safety, security, and quality of use in general.

2600net just isn't a good environment for people with disabilities whether mental, physical or emotional.
