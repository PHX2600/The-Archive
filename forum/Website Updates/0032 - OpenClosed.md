What do you think about making the board only readable by registered users?

I strongly prefer to keep it open, not only would that be consistent with the spirit in which we physically meet, but some of the users post material of such high quality that I'm sure others would like to reference to these forums and the site (for example: opcode and his great assembly tutorials).

I agree with phigan, these boards should be open to the public.  A registered users section would be kool, but the majority of the boars should be open.

Yah, I agree about letting anyone in - A mod-only forum would be h0tt, though.
