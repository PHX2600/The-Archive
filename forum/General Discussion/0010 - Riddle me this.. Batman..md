## Riddle me this.. Batman.

While working on some network design concepts for my house for the 2008 year I am coming to a small issue when it comes to photos and videos, specifically in the management and distribution part. Keep in mind I am shooting for distribution in this case, specifically to the house, not the whole internet. I would like to be able to file every last one of my pictures to a storage device, have them 'pre-tagged' so that 'category, tag, date, etc.' is already there that way any program I use to pull or reference our picture / video library the tags are already there and I can search them down instantly without having to setup a new library every time I need a solution or a new device would want to access this method. 

Secondly I want the videos and pictures to be able to be accessed from anywhere on the private network of the home, any device, be it computer desktop, laptops, TV, etc. I don't want really duplicates running around of home videos or pictures when I can have them homed on a reliable RAID server with some sort of off-site setup (in the future).  I personally have not seen a solution, be it windows, linux, mac, that can meet all these needs. I also was trying to see if there was a standard that follows that 'pre-tagged' concept so that I can simply 'auto-tag' pictures I have done in the past if the library is being imported into a new solution.

Hit me up with ideas, suggestions or input as this has been a itch on the brain I can't completely scratch.

For the image tagging, I've recently started using Google's Picasa to tag my several thousand photos (UGH!  What a task!).  I use Picasa because, from my understanding, it writes the tags to the photos themselves, rather than a separate database.

Other sources on the Picasa Google Groups pages confirm this as well.

In terms of being able to access from anywhere, Picasa natively allows you to view your photos on Tivo media players, but if you don't have one, I suggest setting up a network drive, or maybe even a shared folder.  From there I haven't really thought it through, but that should get you started.

Interesting so that is perfect, that meta data will work perfectly if that is the case. Knowing that it also will work fine with Tivo is cool.  Not sure I want to go with Tivo or not since I am still considering streaming media still to a standard  homegrown media box.

Have you seen [url=http://www.plutohome.com:3duo1b8e]Pluto home> distro yet? I'm not sure if it does what you were saying, but it might (with all the other crazy shit it does).

No I had not seen that yet, I don't think I am quite ready to add in home automation. However It does open some potential if I did want to add it in. Thanks for the link.
