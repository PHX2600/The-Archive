"Forums are slow because its the holiday season!" True or False?
Taking into account all the post's on this forum I was able to compile these stats.

Numeric Month and year post counts:
[code:zxc54ox1]
01 308
02 363
03 205
04 177
05 195
06 205
07 444
08 525
09 369
10 264
11 277
12 364
2007 43
2008 1565
2009 1382
2010 706
[/code:zxc54ox1]

Day post counts:
[code:zxc54ox1]
fri 651
mon 505
sat 395
sun 412
thu 548
tue 597
wed 588
[/code:zxc54ox1]

So back to the original question then Do we see a decline in posts over the winter holiday periods?
See for yourself.

So if we can bet on this trend then we should see post counts rise going into the holidays after hitting lows in October. Not sure If we are seeing that or not. Maybe phlak could compare my graph to the over all site trafic and see if there is a correlation.

Thanks for watching!

PS.
I also did a word frequency analysis of all the posts in the forum which is pretty fun to look through.
The results of that are attached below. One file sorted alphabetically by word and one sorted numerically by count.
