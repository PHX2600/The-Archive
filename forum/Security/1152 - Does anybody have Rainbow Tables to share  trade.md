## Does anybody have Rainbow Tables to share / trade?
Posted by **saltthefries** on Sat November 14th, 2009 11:31:30 PM

Rainbow tables have recently caught my interest, but they're gigantic files. I'm stuck with a pretty terrible internet connection, but I was looking at getting a few over bittorrent. Does anybody else have rainbow tables that they'd like to share or trade? I'll change my download plans if I know somebody else already has a table for an algorithm I'm interested in and download something to share.

I'm interested in getting some decent sized tables ~10gb for MD5, LM, and NTLM. 
It looks like there are some tables at:

and

Of course there's The Church of Wifi's WPA Rainbow tables:

I've spent the last week or so downloading the Renderlab top 1000 SSID WPA rainbow tables. My point is that these can be gigantic, and my internet connection is awfully slow. It seems like the best way to trade these around is on hard drives at the meetings after one of us downloads one. I'll bring said WPA rainbow tables on my laptop or an external drive for anybody to copy at the meeting. I'd like a decent MD5 table if someone else is interested in blowing through bandwidth.

&quot;Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon filled with tapes.&quot;

Totally. I don't have the CoW Rainbow tables, actually. And the internet connection at my apartment is awful. So I'd love to do some IRL swapping. 

I'll see what I can muster to share around.

Ok, I have 33.5 gb of WPA-PSK rainbow tables. If you want them, come to the meeting with an external drive or laptop with enough space to fit the data. I'm bringing it on my laptop and a NTFS formatted USB external. It takes about 30 minutes to copy, so you'll want to get started ASAP.
