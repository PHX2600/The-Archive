If enough people are interested, I will risk destroying a 100% fully functional Commodore PET 4016 Model-N by bringing it to the October Meet-Up.

The thing weighs three to five dozen pounds.

I need some people to supply me with two or three boxes of blank 5.25&quot; floppies at the September 2550 midmeet in-order for me to provide clones of diskettes for the October 2600 First Friday meet-up instead of the originals in order to prevent shit from hitting the fan.

I also need some people to volunteer assisting me in moving the damn thing downstairs my parents' house loading into my car noon October First Friday, then unloaded at the cafe around 1:30 to 2pm, then reloaded into the car just before or after midnight, then unloaded at my condo around 1am and brought up a damn narrow flight of stairs and put on a desk.

I need at-least 2 or 3 committed volunteers to help make this possible.

I need to get it from my parents' house to my condo anyways, so I might as well risk bringing to the meet-up while it is already being moved so not risk moving it 4 times instead of twice.

Please do not use the &quot;SCRATCH&quot; command on my PET, it is prone to locking out the floppy drive for nearly a month, and that would ruin this experience for everyone.

This PET only has one fuse for the computer, one fuse for the floppy drive, and no spares, so please *do not* remove nor blow the fuses!

One or more Volunteers need to bring plastic tarp material that they do not mind parting with in order to protect the pet in transfer, additional bubble wrap would be a great donation to in order to wrap the display between both transfers.

If anyone has working &quot;IEEE-488&quot; cable(s) please bring them as my spare broke and I only have one left!

Be aware that if you assist with the PET4016 delivery and departure, that there is *no bathroom on the first floor* in my condo!

I need a volunteer to bring a *very stable* steerable large toy wagon with either *no side panels* or *removable side panels* for moving the PET between every parking lot and building involved!

The PET cannot be left in a vehicle nor outdoors for longer than delivery/departure or the unit will break and malfunction due to the heat.

This is a one-shot deal.

[b:153iaqtd]What:[/b:153iaqtd] PHX2600 [b:153iaqtd]&quot;Who's Soberfest&quot;[/b:153iaqtd] LAN Party @ jargon's!
[b:153iaqtd]When:[/b:153iaqtd] First Friday Night of [b:153iaqtd]October 2nd 2009 starting at 8pm[/b:153iaqtd] until ???.
[b:153iaqtd]Where:[/b:153iaqtd] [url:153iaqtd]http&#58;//maps&#46;google&#46;com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Bashas&amp;sll=33&#46;522793,-111&#46;859016&amp;sspn=0&#46;06998,0&#46;154324&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;radius=4&#46;44&amp;rq=1&amp;ev=zi&amp;ll=33&#46;494846,-111&#46;906441&amp;spn=0,359&#46;845676&amp;t=h&amp;z=13&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=33&#46;494846,-111&#46;906441&amp;panoid=1vtGkO14sTYgYh9y8bIl8g&amp;cbp=12,358&#46;38,,0,8&#46;51[/url:153iaqtd] &lt;-- Go here then turn into the drive, into the complex, and take the first left past the speed bump! Parking is either to the left or right in the uncovered parking spots there-after or where-ever else you can find to park! Then head to the nestled-away South-West-most condo in the complex which has a courtyard gate facing West. Please don't ring the dinner bell.

Thanks for all the people that pledge time and supplies to make this possible in advance! There will be a Playstation2/SuperNintendo/Gamecube/DVD/LAN/StarGate-Universe-Pilot party at my condo, along with snacks and drinks.Remember to bring your inhalers if you have asthma and be sure to bring Benadryl or what-not if you are allergic to cats and other animals!

Maximum safe Occupancy is 12 hulks plus 20 to 35 shrimps, and we have to keep the noise down due to there not being any soundproofing in the firewalls of the building! Remember, there is only a steep narrow staircase to the second floor with no bathroom on the ground floor, and only one entrace/exit to the complex, only one entrance/exit to my courtyard within, and only one entrance/exit to my condo within that.

I have my own personal small flagstone courtyard for smoke breaks and outdoor-time, It can only comfortably hold with sitting space 3 to 6 hulks or 8 to 12 shrimps at a time, or 15+ adults with standing-room-only. The upstairs can hold 9 to 12 people but has very limited seating, and the main room downstairs can hold 12 to 22 adults depending on how much extra furniture is provided and how much is put in the cash hat to pay the a/c bill! Please bring extra chairs and tables if you can!

Please bring extra snacks and if you drink bring your own beer! I suggest buying your beer and extra potluck snacks around 6pm at Safeway across the street from the Unlimited Coffee Cafe, putting it in the trunk of you car at the cafe, then bringing it to the LAN party with you when we start departing for my LAN party between 7pm and 9:30pm! The LAN party starts at 8pm, so I will be leaving for my condo at 7pm. It is 22 miles to my condo from the Unlimited Coffee WiFi cafe.

There is both a Jack-in-the-Box and KFC on the same side of the street as my complex. There are two 24/7 Circle K corner stores in both opposite directions on the same side of the street for a very short wall in either direction from the complex my condo is in, the Bashas across the street closes at 11pm, there is a 24/7 McDonalds drive thru next to the Bashas, and a 24/7 What-A-Burger drive thru a few miles down the cross street. There is a large cheap gas station on the reservation at McKellips quite a few miles down the Hayden cross-street.

I will order max-speed Cox internet and Cox Cable TV just the month of October just for this event! I will have ten 3gal water dispensers and three 12 packs of TP rolls. There are power outlets in the courtyard as well. If you want your music played on my stereo it holds up to five *NON-RW* audio cd's. The Wireless Router at my condo is a &quot;Linksys WRT54 G/GS/GL&quot; with the &quot;Tomato&quot; firmware.

We need at-least 3 additional organizer people in order to have enough human-power to pull this off! (Already noted: Kilo and t0rX are the two candidate &quot;bouncers&quot;.)

I am looking forward to having a fun venture with you guys, seeing you all at the meet-up, and hopefully actually having this party! <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: -->

[b:1metuk6p]t0rX:[/b:1metuk6p] Are you going to make sure the cable modem I have *can* actually pump out the full 22mbit/s? It is a Scientific Atlanta DPC2100R2.

[b:1metuk6p]PHLAK:[/b:1metuk6p] Are you going to attend the LAN party to make sure Tomato firmware doesn't EAD? RetroTech1541 gave me the hacked Linksys WRT he bought from you.

[b:1metuk6p]Automated Penguin:[/b:1metuk6p] You going to bring your printer and PCB stuff? I can set up a rock-solid table for you to do all that at the LAN party.

[b:1metuk6p]XlogicX:[/b:1metuk6p] You going to come to help out Automated Penguin if he brings his stuff, and help me crack open the shell on the PET in order to dig around inside it?

[b:1metuk6p]TerrorDrone:[/b:1metuk6p] Are you coming in order to screw around with and poke around in the PET? Also, are you going to stay late at the LAN party in-order to get some serious PHX2600 Badge tinkering time in?

[b:1metuk6p]hexatex:[/b:1metuk6p] You want to dig around in my intelligence algorithms reverse engineers and play my copy of the superior **Gamecube** version of Enter the Matrix?

[b:1metuk6p]Kilo:[/b:1metuk6p] You want to play around with XAMPP and Net_SmartIRC bot code? You could team up with hexatex at the LAN party and attempt to apply the correlation tallying algorithm to Project Bluebook.

[b:1metuk6p]RetroTech:[/b:1metuk6p] You going to bring your commodore stuff to the LAN party? You could also teach people how to use a MIDI keyboard.

[b:1metuk6p]Evil1:[/b:1metuk6p] You going to come prank some Walmarts and Parking Garages via Skype with us at the LAN party? You could also bring some computer games with you for all of us to enjoy!

[b:1metuk6p]Dual:[/b:1metuk6p] You going to hang out and chillax with us phone newbs and teach us how it is done? Maybe you could show us the extent of your Japanese experience.

[b:1metuk6p]dxh:[/b:1metuk6p] You could work out with TerrorDrone the specifics of the badge inner-workings with Automated Penguin at the LAN party, and even obtain some cool FREE-99's from other party-goers.

[b:1metuk6p]CultLeader:[/b:1metuk6p] You want to see my Dune 2000 video game and three DVD Dune mini-series box set? You can also check out the Warhammer PSX game I mentioned. <!-- s:D --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><!-- s:D -->

[b:1metuk6p]taryn:[/b:1metuk6p] You going to stick Zaphraud with the baby and come sing the Party Hard song with us?

[b:1metuk6p]zaphraud:[/b:1metuk6p] You are not really going to let her go alone are you? Btw, you going to someday teach me how to burn a functioning redbook audio CD with a functional data track?

[b:1metuk6p]Ugly:[/b:1metuk6p] You should chat it up with t0rX at the party! You still working on that voice actuator project? You could team up with RetroTech1541 with his MIDI keyboard!

[b:1metuk6p]Zapperlink:[/b:1metuk6p] I am not suggesting you ever come, because if you did the man would not stick it to you. &lt;/reverse psychology&gt; (You could detail the secure wall conversations you mentioned if you did.)

[b:1metuk6p]AltF4Warrior:[/b:1metuk6p] I think you and your wife are the only ones RetroTech1541 and I ran into at Phoenix Comicon. You two aren't going to miss out on a good LAN party are you?

[b:1metuk6p]fightgar:[/b:1metuk6p] You coming? Come on you HAVE to come!!! I could show you my The Cheat action figure collection, If anyone is up to it, we could use my The Cheat collection as figurines for a AD&amp;D 2e, D&amp;D 3.0/3.5 or D&amp;D 4.0 game!

Any individual mentioned may invite their significant other or otherwise one best, or one close friend, or one family member. I do not suggest inviting people additional to that.

If we get the whole me + my cat + 15 invited individuals + 2 invited couples + 15 additional significant others / best friends / close friends / family members, This will be 33 persons plus a cat and the kitchen sink which is probably the ridiculously extreme maximum amount of living beings that can be shoved into my condo at once.

This party will have punch card badges. You need the damn badge to be unhindered if you leave the complex and attempt to come back and get questioned by the condo community groundsman who is often awake from 1am to 4am watering the various regions of grass.

[b:1metuk6p]Btw, don't walk around the walkways between 1:05am and 1:45am or else you will get really wet, and if the groundsman in unhappy with the prior watering or else missed the first watering he will do it again from 3:05am to 3:45am!! The patch of grass immediately outside my courtyard gate is normally scheduled to be watered between 1:33am-1:38am and again from 3:33am-3:38am[/b:1metuk6p]

God you're crazy, but I don't get to enough parties so I'll come and bring my synth. Nobody is gonna be interested in a couple 1541 disk drives, I don't think.

Hopefully, I won't be the only one to come.

Nice, snarky comment.

I did not steal RetroTech1541's password, and those are suggestions to invited guests, not imaginary things they say.

You are on the invite list too if you hadn't noticed.

Kilo tried to get the night off for that, but won't be able to come due to only being able to *maybe* only even make it to just an hour or two of the meet-up in October. <!-- s:roll: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><!-- s:roll: --> 

RetroTech1541 is coming, and t0rX is supposedly coming too if he doesn't have to &quot;bounce for strip club&quot; that night. <!-- s;) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><!-- s;) -->

My (W)LAN party for October 2nd 2009 has been canceled due to not enough RSVP's and too many people that did RSVP simply flaking out; the one for November 6th 2009 is still go.

t0rX you can still hang out that night, anyone else that wants to chill can hang out at my pad too, there just won't be a bitch-load of food, beer, nor any Cable TV etc.

Next LAN Party is Friday November 6th 2009 after the meet-up.

Who is able to come, what should people bring, and should there  be a theme for the party?
