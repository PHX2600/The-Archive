## Beer Caps
Posted by **TerrorDrone** on Thu July 10th, 2008 01:20:07 PM

When brewing my home made beer i found that capping the bottle is a drab and
straining process so im thinking about build my on electronic capping device.
There are devices like this forsale but more than i want or can pay for right
now.

Im working the first article design out on CAD and am going to measure the
amount of pressure my produce when i hand clamp the caps. Now just to figure out
what kind of device I'm gonna use to make the clamps close and how to activate
it. So if anyone has any ideas or input it would be very appearicated. And if
anyone wants to drink some of my home made beer that's no problem either(make 5
gallons at a time and that's about 1/2 gallon more than i can drink in a
sitting, lol).

Ok, I said I would like to brew someday.

Could you answer some questions about your brewing setup and process?

Here:

  1. What kind of equipment do you use? And how much did it cost you?
  2. Do you get your brew materials locally or do you order online? Where?
  3. any other information you'd wanna volunteer :)

Thanks man, oh yeah, and what's your favorite brew off the shelf?

Harbor Freights sells a small kit that goes for about $50, its enough to get you
started, but I would kill to taste some home brew as long as I don't go blind.

nak

there is a place here in mesa that i got most of my stuff from home brew depot

its on baseline and alma school right by the daycare and beauty school

i cant remeber how much everything cost think i spent about 70 bucks or so for
the kit and the ingreidents plus free shirt and dvd

for boiling the water i bought a turkey fryer setup off of amazon cause trying
to boil 5 gallons of water on an electric range is the crap

bottling i starting to get a bit more pricing than i want and alot of work so i
am most likely going to be getting a refillable keg setup they sell there

i would recommend this store as the staff was really helpful for beginners

as for off the shelf it depends on where and why i am drinking it but the most i
drink is black and tans (guiness and bass)

Cool, blacks are good, have you tried New Belgiums 1554?  And their seasonal for
winter 2º below is also a treat, very hoppy.

Thanks for the info, I might check around for a home brew depot -like store
closer to me, I live in northeast phoenix, but $70 isn't too bad if you think
about it, just have to have around 70 x 12oz beers and it's paid for itself :)
